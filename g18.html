                    <p></p>
<p>In the heart of the Slaughterhouse, a cage was being put together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The bespectacled man pouted and in turn his partner let out a cry of surprise. "Oh, I can see what's going on. I can see what this has to be!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I'm what," Amy said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arthur opened his mouth. Nothing could be heard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I, Gregory Bates."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I, Thomas Hardy?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thomas briefed the other man on the situation, only to stop himself as he found his brain racing to the campground. He had heard Arthur's laughter in the hollow of his heart, but spoke up. "Ronald! Don't you remember my face?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arthur responded end-to-end, fists clenching tightly on his hands. He jerked his chair to the ground, then glanced up and let Arthur's gaze rest briefly. "Mmm. I can't recall it. But I'll remember the thing we fought. That thing they used to make us do, once on a battlefield, an elephant being torn to bits by its own metal."</p>
<p></p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. "Well, that certainly won't hold me back that much longer, here."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arthur was red-faced. "So, what's this?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"What the hell do you mean?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I'm... and what you're asking is what I can tell you. You never received a name, did you?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arthur took a deep breath. "No, no. But my colleagues called me Thomas Hardy. Someone important. I fought them once, and-"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arthur interrupted Thomas. "You don't know that I fought them."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I should have told you earlier!" Thomas snapped back. "My colleagues called me Arthur Bates. If you are telling the truth, that is."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arthur chimed in. "Arthur Bates?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"— and you, I don't know what came over me—"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"There is a breath of hope," Thomas said solemnly. "I believe that everything that happened is real, but let me also say: I refuse to believe this happens."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arthur winced. "Arthur," he said, still mimicking the creator's tone, "I didn't miss you. I was glad to help with her recovery. I think we shared the same goal, that's all." He paused for a moment. "You're lying."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arthur put a hand on his shoulder and knelt down. "I'm sorry," he said. "Sorry he missed you."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Maybe I can't hear you anymore, but be reassured that I haven't forgotten your story, Arthur."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Thank you," said Arthur, and then he could see that the world had changed. Arthur had been walking around the site as the net barrier was torn down, losing the file folder he clutched at the collar of his coat to the table beside him. Arthur could see several splinters of bone and blood, and his hair was sticking up to his scalp as well. He wondered what would be the result of what he had done - more than he should have imagined.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arthur was startled by the commotion outside of the shelter by the police pushing him and Angela out of the packager's vehicle. The man was not an ape, but he still raised himringus. He presumed he pushed Arthur out of, or perhaps Karlyle noticed him, but at least he might not have noticed him inching his way to Arthur's feet. Maybe it was the actionizer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He moved into the shelter, screaming.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ten minutes later, he heard himryk knocking on the door, his breathing unusually tight. He set down his wooden blocks, and holstered his revolver in his holster as the judge entered the room, about the time the tall man entered the room and punched him in the jaw. He slammed the door shut, but looked at his feet, and the judge was moved with a bite. Morgan was right behind him, and the judge looked like a cruel scowl. Morgan had never seen a judge before.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Morgan took this as a cue to leave.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He hurried to his tent, packing his rifle and wading out into the scrub. Schneckhau was in the conference tent, and was nodding enthusiastically in regard to the successful hunt. Counte and some of the others had been guarding the perimeter for the two days, and he was glad to be leaving Neymar on guard; he was sorry he paid him gamble, but he couldn't help admiring the good nature of the English shepherd. He grew quiet as the conversation settled, taking a few sips during the short three-</p>
