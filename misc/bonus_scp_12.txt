Item #: SCP-2459

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Instances of SCP-2459-1, SCP-2459-A instances, and SCP-2459-B instances are to be contained within a standard Containment Vault, specified for each instance. SCP-2459 is not to be stored in a standard containment vault, instead, each instance of SCP-2459 is to be placed in a different Containment Vault. As a reminder to each Foundation employee that they cannot access a Vault without prior exercise, no use for Vault 0 is made. All instances of SCP-2459 are to be located in Foundation Headquarters. The central location assigned to SCP-2459 is designated the "Hallucinarium". SCP-2459 is not permissioned to roam freely.

As SCP-2459 has the ability to interact with any other noise or sound, it is recommended that its long harpoon weapon be anchored outside of the hall.

No other instances of SCP-2459 are to be placed in SCP-2459's Hallucinarium. SCP-2459 is allowed to roam freely in the Hallucinarium as long as it is accompanied by several other amounts of noise.\1

Description: SCP-2459 is a device of indeterminate design and function in which a sound is produced and reflected. SCP-2459 is not a viable method for spreading its anomalous effect. However, the hallconstoration of SCP-2459 has proven to be highly resistant to the strain of SCP-███, and SCP-2459 will slowly remove itself from the hall until containment is reestablished.

SCP-2459's effects are not influenced by outside sound. Sound in psychological decibels do not change SCP-2459's effects, and has not been discovered to have any sub-level affect. All sound within SCP-2459 will yield its effect. Once SCP-2459 is removed from the soundscape it will reappear in the office, which remains unaffected by SCP-███. SCP-███ does not appear to affect SCP-2459's effects, but the effects are rather temporary.

When SCP-2459 is not provided with a sound source it will cover its entire visual field and create a listener in the form of a standard human man. The subject will neither perceive SCP-2459, nor are they aware of its existence. Control of their motor skills will be affected less. Additionally, controlled sounds (such as spoken language) will not and require SCP-████ for test purposes.
