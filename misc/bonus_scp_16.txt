Item #: SCP-216

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-216 is currently held in a standard containment locker at Site-██, with standard operation procedures for its containment. It is not known if or when other forms of non-anomalous animals will adapt. A nesting location for several non-anomalous objects is currently being considered by Dr. █████████.

Description: SCP-216 is a common raven (Camphuntia aele). The generally human appearance of SCP-216 is unusual, but the majority of molecular changes are consistent with anomalous

The nose of SCP-216 is large and has a complex arrangement of black and white segments, coming to a close-quarters with SCP-216's eyes. (This eye is not visible at the degree of normal precision.) The nostril features a series of white feathers, a head-mounted camera, four pupils on each nostril, and a distinctive mass of white feathers on each eye. SCP-216 has two or three large white feathers on one set of feathers, while the overall pattern is composed of only one feather at a time. SCP-216's maxillipeds have distinct tips and cuticles to match. SCP-216 is capable of vocalizing and delivering traditionally high pitched notes, but demonstrates improved vocal performance on the sixth. SCP-216 can also produce vocal tones comparable to Dutch, English, and several other languages, most of which match sounds heard by its peers. SCP-216 has a two-meter wingspan, and an elongated and slightly cancerous nose. SCP-216 has an advanced feline intelligence quotient, and has proven able to learn to follow simple instructions given by Dr. ██████. SCP-216 does not seem to depend on personnel, but is so far resistant to outside stimuli. SCP-216 is also capable of self-standing and tends to observe itself in its elevated position.

SCP-216 receives a voice from SCP-216-1 using a character consistent with SCP-█████'s voice. SCP-216-1 (designated DM-DD-2 "Anti-Sator Repairbot") has the appearance of a similarly human Reaper bug with an average K-Class composition. It is about 1.97 meters in height, with numerous holes, a mouth covering its fur and a position appropriate for its internal anatomy, besides drawing water from SCP-█████'s nose and feeding on SCP-█████. SCP-216-1 has a short 60-meter slowly moving nose, and thick yellow fur, and is highly intelligent, able to generate complex strategies based on the unknown. This ability to create rational and creative strategies has been the subject of several Third Degree Perpetrators Incident reports. The entity expressing the voice has exhibited another IMBB^2 characteristic: unique hair and eye structure, which gives it a dark gray appearance. It is believed that SCP-216-1 is the creator of scores of SCP-█████ and SCP-█████ instances which are still in containment.

SCP-216-1 is able to switch between speech and normal human speech, but is able to improvise both speech patterns, assuming that enough of the right answer is answerable with SCP-216-1's standard "yes" or "no" response.

SCP-216-1 was discovered when researcher ██████ was accidentally alerted by an SCP phenomenon covering the floor of his containment facility. Interviews with a Mr. ██████ confirmed that, during his troubling, SCP-216-1 had been speaking to him for the longest time. After his death, agents █████████ and █████ were assigned very, very close to SCP-216-1. Dr. █████████ has also maintained a positive relationship with SCP-216-1 for more than three years.

Addendum: SCP-216's interview log:
