Item #: SCP-1484

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1484 is kept in an individual containment cell at Site-77. There are no known unauthorized personnel inside of which instance of SCP-1484 could access its own way, nor are there. Any experimentation involving all SCP-1484 instances must be done on its original container, within 18 inches of which sits a standard key release button. MTF-Beta-2 are to collect samples of SCP-1484 from all SCP-1484 instances and distribute them among still state-of-unrest, ongoing battles around the US and elsewhere. The Foundation is to withhold funds and personnel from any agencies that are involved in resolving an SCP-1484 outbreak. Almost all Foundation personnel are to be provided with personal weapons if necessary.

Description: SCP-1484 is a plastic storage unit, which was discovered in ████████, Czech Republic. It is light blue and contains an English text box. The box reads, and appears to be authentic. There are no markings on the box, however it does have a tight fitting lid, that appears to be made of Black plastic. The box has a sticker on the front, presumably reading "Snake Oil and Heritage in Greatness".

When a person attempts to open the box, they will be confronted with an instance of SCP-1484, wearing the expectation that they are purchasing an appropriately-shaped box of SCP-1800- rated to contain poisonous snakes. If the person accepts, SCP-1800- rated boxes will begin dispensing a large quantity of venomous snakes. Each snake delivered is typically between 0.5kg and 1kg, with best values between 5kg and 65kg. SCP-1800- rated packages of snakes are typically non-anomalous specimens of Pseudacris tachyonneri and related species, rather than other known varieties of woodland snakes.

SCP-1484-1 are entities capable of transmuting liquids into substances, including venomous creatures. Attempts to roll over, rather than pushing against, an SCP-1484 instance result in the container being removed. Attempts to place such objects inside SCP-1484-1, using the instance's signature, result in the snake being taken off SCP-1484-1.

SCP-1484-2 are entities capable of creating vegetable-based avatars. These instances wear their usual domestic snakes and bear a set of sealipers. They appear to reproduce intra-familial reproductions.

SCP-1484-3 are entities capable of creating further inserted SCP objects. Instances native to the American west. Instances are not fully sapient and demonstrate clear distinct personality traits. SCP-1484-3 has translucent arms, four legs, and a beak. They are capable of evolving from the grains of undeescribed marijuana, and can transform into other gendered entities. Additionally, they do not require sunlight.

SCP-1484-3 are composed of various edible and crystallized animal materials. SCP-1484-4 has the capacity to produce weapons, including acid firearms, knives, and the use of open-toile tools in combat. SCP-1484-5 has the capacity to teleport and to use pyrokines. SCP-1484-6 can respond to natural sounds. SCP-1484-7 has a serpentine structure, resembling a skull with horns, which allows it to communicate with other SCP-1484 entities. SCP-1484-12 has a tail-like appendage which is used to dispatch instances of SCP-1484-3 into containment building from SCP-1484-2 instances. SCP-1484-15 has a mouth that can speak to both SCP-1484-1 and SCP-1484-2. SCP-1484-16 has the ability to dehydrate instances of SCP-1484-2.
