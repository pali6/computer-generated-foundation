Item#: SCP-2136

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: About seventy-five prototypes of SCP-2136 are kept in a standard non-anomalous biosphere research facility in [REDACTED].

Description: SCP-2136 is a cloth full of flour, rice, and other carbohydrates. The outer casing of SCP-2136 measures approximately ten centimeters in thickness and holds two half-liter mounds. Other seventy-five hundred additional flour mounds were redesigned after two years and outlived its of date. SCP-2136 exhibits characteristics of an Ethiopian blueberry cake. Other anomalous properties mainly self-repairable.

SCP-2136 is non-hazardous in small amounts. The SCP-2136's anomalous properties are shown to extend beyond SCP-2136 itself, so long as SCP-2136 is a guest. Within the SCP-2136's biosphere, researchers expressed concern over SCP-2136's health and reported veterinary complaints about the anomaly. Also, it is impossible to eat SCP-2136 and the intended part. Testing proves this first half, while use of edible additives that mimic SCP-2136 to improve food quality is possible. Containment staff have added it to their diet.

Results: It is unknown where SCP-2136 comes from. Unusually, this occurred with other extant biological organisms. Subjects who commenced the process are the only known entities to possess SCP-2136. Test subjects found no anomalous properties, symptoms or effects. Asked to explain their eating habits and that SCP-2136 drew them into, under the effects of normal food. SCP-2136 is also commonly used as a decoration in the SCP Foundation, now commonly referred to as SCP- through 20 of the Foundation's various facilities and facilities.

Addendum 2136-1: The following experimental trials can be found in the Document-2136-1: Tries 1-14

[00:13] Recent changes in disease conditions. Tried changing a vegetable to [REDACTED]^7^2. After a second test subject in the first phase of testing found symptoms of acute ambulance poisoning, the subject's medication was also changed to more effective anti-ambulance medication. SCP-2136 was a food item with a different effect. When testing was subject to experimentation, SCP-2136 demonstrates existing attempts at responding to the stimuli there are not coming into fruition.

[00:46] Old man sets foot inside SCP-2136. This was the first known occasion where the substance had been eaten and found to have had the local physician notice this. The subject's face began to melt and his eyes closed. A small, white hole had opened in the subject's eyes. Seamus O'Connor found this around ████ hours later. The subject woke up later on, hanging in a cell. He was treated for his injuries after being removed and given Class-A amnestics.

[01:45] Living tests show that the object can be used as a latrine. Like all cultivated plants, the experiment showed the fruit of SCP-2136 gradually becoming less marked, with slight overgrowth per instance. J.P. found the object between ███ and ████ years old. It uses SCP-2136 in its cooking oil as a new source of alternate non-toxic coloring requesting subject be placed in a special environment.

[02:48] "THIS IS WHAT THE BEGINNING IS!"

SCP-2136 is discovered inside a television receiving units having been removed on drive. It is not noticed when personnel bring it into the test room for consumption. SCP-2136 takes on a more aromatic taste and aroma after 15 minutes and six hours of consumption. "THIS IS WHAT THE BEGINNING IS!>", the words are said by the Subject shown by the Subject's recorder. The Subject's iPod autosequence toggles between Air or iTunes within thirty seconds. Subject is questioned to why he did not relay this information to his Doctor during testing. Subject claims that he may have been aware of this, but that he does not know where SCP-2136 comes from.

The Tests:

Time removed: Time likely evolved with the status of ██ extensive trial testing involving SCP-2136.

Time consumed: SCP-2136 consumed in above temperature and placed in the kitchen to experience its effect.

Notes: See Document 2136-1-1 for research and testing question.

Time lost: SCP-2136 spent in the SCP
