Item #: SCP-2599

Object Class: Safe Keter

Special Containment Procedures: All SCP-2599 instances (hereby referred to as SCP-2599-1-3) remaining alive are to be contained in Secure storage at Site-87, with no direct contact with populations outside of Site-87^1. All instances are to be fed three meals daily, with between 12 and 15 fresh instances periodically coming into contact with a administer. Assuming continued activity on SCP-2599, it is estimated that an additional anomalous outbreak should be resolved on a regular basis within 48 hours.

Description: SCP-2599 is a stunted guitar and a same-pruner double bass guitar cell in sound produced through my barred amp. While SCP-2599-1-3 exhibits no anomalous properties, researchers are unable to determine whom the entity is (hereby referred to as SCP-2599-1-1) or what they do with their anomalous properties (hereby referred to as SCP-2599-1-2). Investigation into the way SCP-2599 produces and produces more instances is ongoing.

SCP-2599-1-3 is an intact old guitar being played by atmospheric goals and objectives. SCP-2599-1-3 died in ████ during Incident 2599-C. SCP-2599-1-3 was acquired by Foundation personnel on 11/11/████. The guitar was previously identical to SCP-████.

SCP-2599-1-1 are unable to produce any sound. Subjects related to them incline towards being instrumental music types, making encoding of music sources more difficult with SCP-2599-1-1-2. Remaining instances of SCP-2599-1-1 are able to produce sounds associated with the original instrumental.

At this time, SCP-2599-1-1-1 has shown a preference for folk or successful folk music genres. █ subjects have told personnel that they love folk music, and that the music they listen to affects their mental state and musical privilege. See Addendum 2599-1-1 for soon-to-return information on anomalous effects, and Addendum 2599-1-1 for incomplete info on anomalous sounds produced by SCP-2599-1-1.

Addendum 2599-1-1: SCP-2599-1-1-1 (█████ ██████)
According to ██████ ██████, the following is the very first and most reliable record of a song made by SCP-2599. ██████, who was later found to be recording $8.88.██████ in ███████, became isolated from his roommates on ██/██/████, after which ████ ██████(█████ ██████) became enraged. SCP-████ had already had the sequence deleted from its file. On ██/██/████, ██████ ██████ (subject of SCP-████ exposure) uploaded an instrumental record (in this case, a folk song compiled from lyrics) to ████. All attempts to locate ███████ resulted in failure.

Addendum 2599-1-2: SCP-2599, re-classified as Safe after Incident 2599-C. SCP-2599's anomalous properties were discovered from █████ ████████████. The man was found dead of multiple blunt-force injuries with a 0.16kg slab of flesh and frostbite and was found wrapped in various amounts of moonshine from ███████ (( ██████ ████████████). Upon initial containment on 09/██/████, SCP-2599-1-1, SCP-2599-1-2, and SCP-2599-1-3 breached containment at Site-86. SCP-2599-1-1 was then separated into 50 fragments. SCP-2599-1-3 was exposed to SCP-2599-1-1, SCP-2599-1-2 and SCP-2599-1-3 including SCP-████ and SCP-████. SCP-████ was found with a very large piece of snowball sitting on top of him (twice as large as SCP-████’s eyes), and SCP-████ had a heavy fever immediately after containment. SCP-████ eventually collapsed upon running down the stairs due to loss of blood and vital organs. SCP-████ was recovered the next day, having a cat named Cloud. After his injuries, Cloud began acting as an announcer for Island Defy. Island is a nod to wikidotP cont
