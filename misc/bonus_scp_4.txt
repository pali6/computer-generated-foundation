Item #: SCP-1047

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1047 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Personnel are forbidden from entering SCP-1047's containment chamber unless provided with direct permission from the O5 command, and are allowed to leave SCP-1047's cell individually if supervised by another, but are forbidden from communicating with SCP-1047 unless directed to do so by the top level of O5 command.

SCP-1047 can exhibit behaviorisms that place it in the "typical" dressing of an adult human. This behavior is close to humanoid, and is subject to some restrictions with regard to behavior. For information about the nature of SCP-1047's behavior, see Addendum 1.

Description: SCP-1047 is an adult male human of dark skin, brown eyes, and freckles. It currently has a black carotid artery, which was noticed one day when studying SCP-███. These features were rapidly discovered with Dr. ████, who took the unusual distinction of becoming fabulously handsome when approached by enemy forces. SCP-1047 is capable of telepathic communication with personnel within 50 kilometers. SCP-1047 displays intelligence in a similar manner to that of a human, though its primary motivation is to ensure blood sacrifice is performed in quarantine. SCP-1047 displays a loyal and interest in the pride of its fellow staff, who are known as "Mia's. "

When SCP-1047 is given a blood sacrifice, SCP-1047 takes the blood of the victim and produces a prodigious amount of SCP-1047's own breastmilk. This breastmilk is one of the most resilient biological materials available, in any sense. SCP-1047 should then drink the blood, in order to survive. SCP-1047 will not drink it, but will drink it admirably though in very small doses. The frequency of successful splinks in successive generations shall be lessened by the amount of breastmilk produced. This preference appears to have indexical.

SCP-1047 underwent a complete regeneration on ██/██/2004 and has not recur in any other interactions with the Foundation since. When not being administered a blood sacrifice, SCP-1047 will revert to an "emaciated" pet by animate and hurtingly eating a possum [See Addendum 1].
