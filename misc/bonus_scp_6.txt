Location: █████ ██, ██████, USA

Looks like something out of ██████ products in ██████, and no labels. Also unclear if there's any distinguishing mark on these as well as the container. I'm not seeing the brand.

If there is a Keter-level 1-2013 restriction, I will upload my name to the Group of Interest Database.
