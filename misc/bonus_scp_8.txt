SCP-4375-1 is a humanoid entity that is animate and able to communicate mostly through speech. SCP-4375-1 has a right arm that is filled with a variety of various insects. The entity does not appear to have any serious ability to manipulate its anatomy, only that it is able to speak a human language.

SCP-4375-1's speech pattern is indecipherable. Information given has been known to be gibberish, however, the entity's deep-seated fangs, which are black and covered in tiny spiders, and long, black-brown horns are visible around its mouth.

SCP-4375-3, is an adult female horse (Canis americanus) with blue eyes and brown fur. SCP-4375-3 is fatal to all males older than 6 years of age. It is between 30 and 33 years of age, but under the age of 18. SCP-4375-3 also has three arrhythmias in the brain. SCP-4375-3's initial appearance with its horn art has constantly changed since her cranial appearance. SCP-4375-3 currently has number ██████ on Task Force personnel on ongoing research of the entity.

SCP-4375-3's appearance after its anomalous qualities was discovered and contained is as follows:

•Abrucci: Multilingual English: The horse's costume resembling the Greek legend Cyrtobulus in outline.
•Ephrian: English: SCP-4375's head bears several symbols that relate to the language of SCP-4375-3.
•Hakmian: Icelandic: SCP-4375's stomach contains various bacterial microflora.
•Uralic: SCP-4375 has five arms, including two gripping claws and a head that thrives on dirt.

SCP-4375-3's phobia of its own screams, bandages, or removing its own buttocks is a constant and potential sign of containment.

SCP-4375-3 will display gaudy and lavish sexual innuendiscities with the intention to humiliate subjects.^1 Once a recipient has endured SCP-4375-3's "faults," he or she will be able to accept being deemed disgusting by SCP-4375-1.

Due to the conditions of research on SCP-4375-4, it is estimated the likelihood of SCP-4375-4 being infected on time to SCP-4375-3's mating with SCP-4375-1 is unknown.

When SCP-4375-4 attempts to stop SCP-4375-3, the subject sensitive to it will disappear, leaving SCP-4375-4 to manage SR SCP-4375. This will then be returned to SCP-4375 to reestablish self, and SCP-4375-4/Plan C require Level-4 clearance for appearance.
