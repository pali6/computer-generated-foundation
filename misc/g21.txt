Note#4143RollAway: Giving this to Rich's MissingScp by Richter: Richter's Lost

Note: I can guess, but I can't imagine Richter could be so curious to hear about his lost SCP-4143.

Note: i was looking at Richter's article and realized this. i can't imagine Richter ever would have published it, but he wrote it anyway. The evidence for this would have been staggering, but he wrote it anyway.
