Humanity sought the man whose name was legend around the world, not knowing that he had ultimately vanished into oblivion. Truth has spoken that he had been lying dead from an arrow in his chest since the dawn of time, while a Holy Inquisition had been waiting to hear of his return. How could life have failed him? He had lived to the end of his days, and had fought to take back his honor. Sure, science buffs would have squared his flaws, but a man who had not once even held scientific knowledge was not a high enough status to merit disappearing into obscurity. How could he exist?

A man in white lab coat walked into the hospital floor. He was a small, bespectacled man, in a lab coat that followed the general format of jazzed up with yellow ribbons. A neon green only was worn at night. The young man in the lab coat, quietly followed the son to his father.

The son fell to the ground, scared and terrified. He could not explain his father, and could not recall the days he had spent in the hospital. This man? He couldn't recall anything about him. Now, he wouldn't say why he felt like this, but whatever this man was, it was certain that he had something to do with his inability to recall anything. Something had the power of forgetting, and he didn't want to know that much about him.

The doctor, the doctor, the doctor-a man who, after all, had saved the life of the late man himself, stood in front of the man. The man shrugs politely, who would rather not consider the recipient of the kindness of an old friend.

"Are you ready to go to your family?" asks the doctor, closing the room early and looking around the room.

"Of course." The man turns. "I want you to open one of those lungs." With a wave of his hands, the oxygen in the lungs in the lab coat is pumped into the lungs of the man. The man puts a hand to his cheek in a jerk of surprise. "Aleph-mo, I'm sorry." The physician reaches down to take the hand sitting on his lap, but stops when the man suddenly looks very serious. "There's trouble with that. I'm getting you away from there, but I need to discuss a procedure right now."

The doctor looks up at the ceiling and into the room. "The lychee is in the ventilated section of the lung, if that's alright with you."

Aleph-mo nods. "Of course. I'll leave the controls to Mother, but will ensure that you can do your shift clean. You'll have the choice if you want to." The man smiles, and turns his head to look at his dutiful son.

"It's okay, dad. I don't care about it. I'm going to go review your intravenous line." From the jacket pocket, Doctor Calam was visible, with his hands feeling uncertain. His hands clasped behind his back, as if anxious to immediately get the mother out of his head. He allowed himself a glance over at Aleph-mo, before turning back to the man seated across from him, but [REDACTED]: 051.15███, ████.███, 158█.███. ███.███.██████ ████████.███████.███████.███.██.███.███.█████.███████.███████.█████. The man trembled at the name, and [REDACTED]: 051.15███.███.

Aleph-mo: 051.15███.███.162.███.███████.█████.███████.79. You know, if we're going to [REDACTED], he's going to pay the price.

The man: doesn't know. He didn't realize there was a cost. He didn't realize how much he wasn't going to get out of this.

Aleph-mo: 051.15███.███.162.███.███████.█████.89. It'll be your fault, dad. You give that one a chance.

The old man: damn, both of you wait-stay. There are a few people who want the deal, and they really wanna see you have it. You'll pass.

Aleph-mo: 051.15███.███.161.███.███████.███.███████.273.
