“Hello and thank you!

I’m A█████ ████. I am a 30-year old female with rosy cheeks and hazel eyes. I’m here to save landscape and make you a beautiful piece of art (don’t worry, you’ve got plenty of space to do that). Actually, I’m A█████ ████, I’m a musician, and we’ve written some songs and music together since around 2004 or 2005. Even up until today, we’ve only made one post, which you probably wouldn’t know since we started counting down.

Changing identities is scary. And it’s done quite a bit of work for sure. But that doesn’t stop you from creating art for anyone who wants to replicate you. Add a feline kaiju statue, and you can sit back, relax, enjoy a song, relax and enjoy the rest tomorrow. And if there’s a sensitive topic here about identity, try to dress your cats here.
