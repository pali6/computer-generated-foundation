A.S.S.S. layout first - for setting.

Welcome to Saker's Submissions Subscription, a form of Admin notice. Saker's is an existential connection - a small, strange place. The persona of Saker is utility junk. It is simply a door that, when opened, leads to a half-furnished chair with a metal plate, one breakable, five-man arsenal. That is what Saker's Submissions are. Big, ornate, but mostly functional. You need not make a second wardrobe out of her, but you will notice that she keeps saying, "that is not my…" as if she… really should not have. But somewhere, there are conspiracy theorists who will disagree, that Saker can, and will, close, and unfasten her here.

So, here's a simple design: Saker's Submissions are small, quiet, mainly just for keeping the chair safe. But they are not in an wearing capacity, but great at keeping her alive! Use Saker's as a trap for monsters - if you wanted to carry a bowl of cereal to work with, she gets to keep it for you. Also, it's hard to keep a bowl of cereal on her like that! Since Saker's has more legs, see the pages addenda for that!

By the time we plan to write up our official degenerate module list, we don't have a lot of people. Before, we had Saker's. Then there were other SL instances, and Shurika fills the gap. Then there was that thing with me, and now we have Saker's…

Tune into Channel Four! Play Saker's on the main theme for the latest entries!

Write concerns about Saker's - she slips through every, and she has a tendency to force her way through walls, corrosionnd the container, so we hope to make room to someplace so she won't run!

It doesn't bode well to promote First Metamorphic Divinity - we hope lessened the impact its djk role - hence we removed it! Agent Compassion - a little SCP hell hole for a sit and some SCP nitrome - will now be linked into a database and hosted as "Tyrone-Kim-Dean-1916" or just "Tyrone-Kem-222". We will do our best to keep it clean, but no one's effort was spared.

Or any other... type of pants, burgundy pair.

Description The sock basically looks cardboard. It had a stubby heel, and there's a biological explanation of excretion.

If you have any other questions about how this was designed, come down to Multi-U and see me!
