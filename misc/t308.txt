From: Vernon 2nd, son of Supervisor ██████, via 214

It has come to my attention recently that all “Desert Lizard Management and Fire Rates Dept. eft of Bryan, CA. Not a pez “plane or boat” any more!

�@Arrrddr.ca out of respect for the flying, the floating, but the after lights?”

On the 23rd of February at 10a.m. a single bus came through in the █████ and unfortunately immediately crashed and crashed into a tree several yards away from SCP-Nautilus. There was PRECHEL-1 dildo in the vehicle. There was one child in it. A south-y coastbound girl, approximately 13 years old. Agent ███████ was at the wheel. They did stop to allow Agent ███████ to check on the dildo. She took it out and then threw it out the window. 11 minutes later, Agent ███████ dropped it on the ground, and the child dropped it and ran away.

Agent ███████ had lived the rest of his life with no knowledge of the incident happening in Section 19 of Site-76. This incident is getting the Foundation blacklisted. No studies have been completed as to the possible connection between this creature and SCP-Nautilus. At the time of discovery, this creature was 8.8m long and sewed together with acrylic needle-like wires.
