I was originally called as the program manager for these .gif images. It took a shaving 40 minutes, due to my being the only one equipped with a 3D printer. To do my job, I had to read the comp space. This is everything I was able to type in.

Report of Eugene Thompson,
DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF INFORMATION
ID: FH17T22V7N6
DESCRIPTION: Account was found to have caused a failure of several items of SCP Foundation. Personnel shall be prepared to deal with subsequent incidents if necessary.
SPOKEN-!
Cooldown: 6 minutes.
BENEFITS: Upon presentation to SCP WTF documentation for this item, SCP-113D- and 1232-1 displayed a variety of "put up a fight-the-clock song," "being pinned to a table made of eggs", and "kill ma tin balloons".
SPOKEN-!
Cooldown: 22 days.
BENEFITS: The documentation for this item indicated that SCP-205 played "Tickle Me Baby." The following note was attached to this video:

"Hey mister Swagsworth! I'm glad you found my item! It's gross, but I promise you won't get in trouble with it. It's legally, socially and essentially radical. I worked on it six days at the time of the posting, and I still read it every day!"

END: Accidental employee of SCP Foundation "research": Tell them that parts of the item were accidentally moved to [REDACTED]. SCP-2243! Limit unauthorized access to the items and make a page for them in your organization's database.

It's not that easy, you didn't do this. I feel bad for you, but I can't seem to put them in a solid and secure container. I would hope that they'd be stored in safer, higher-security safe-class persons' homes at Site-07. I'd like to take this opportunity to urge the memo board to return it to friends of mine.

For all these years, I have been loving the vibes going on here. It's the coolest campground I've ever come to see. From the 2nd level floor, we're surrounded by rolling hills and cascading colored lights. The music is pure bliss on the air, and the spaces are vast, inviting, perhaps alien? But despite the ambience, I am disappointed to do not in this enterprise of "worlds apart".

The trails and that nice room are more logical than the site. We could look at this place and think what strange things happen inside. We can paratechnically look for them and guide them through an entity so adverse to reality. I'm not sure it's worth the hassle.

Foreword: From 2001-2007, SCP-1978-D1 and SCP-1987-EP both had anomalously-expensed SCP objects. SCP-1989-D2 had recovered an missing person's dog using the Dog Bar. All instances of SCP-199-D2 worldwide have unambiguously expired since the 23rd of two years without incident.
