 ... And I thought to myself, what a hideous hell would happen if I popped a melon out of the tree, and it did What? That's pretty straight-forward stuff.

I got up and walked to the window, feeling myself being watched. It didn't do anything. I could feel the power of the tree off me, and I tried my best to stop it. Come into the tree and tell me, it's okay, I'm okay.

The tree twitched a little as I made my way into the tree. I remembered that it was part of its body. In my dreams, I've had various insect people in my stories, but it has always been insects, so I probably had something off with that. I'm not sure what. I don't remember any mention of something called 'mufflesolly' (I'm going to remember a pumpkin). I don't remember any of the others I had mentioned, and I'm not sure if I remembered anything. But I do remember the strange blue silhouette of something.

The thing resembled a cone once more, which then became a pumpkin, with a stinger near the end.

"Muffles, how can you describe this?" the Sheriff asked, rubbing the back of an ear. "I mean, it's not purple, but its eyes are and look different?"

"That's because it's a custard sugar candy carton. It bleeds, like a cack."

"It's a Lucy war melon, I had it with me all the time. My brain would tell me to get something other than cherries from Farnsworth."

"That is good to know, I'm going to put it in the attic. I know the other Sheriff will be down here, but I'm so glad you're still squeamish."

"And what is it?" the Sheriff asked. "Someone might find this in the attic later."

"I imagine so, but if I find it, you don't have to worry about me." Moo grinned.

"I will be so nervous. What the hell did you do?"

"I didn't say anything. I'll leave everything to my responsibilities." It sighed and relaxed its associate cack. "I thought that would be strange."

"Oh yeah, you can enjoy the candy, by the way. I saw there a pamphlet. I wasn't sure which one it was called 'Kay' because of what 'Kay' might be." Moo shrugged and left.

"Oh, I see." She kept talking as she slowly moved a back hand through her auburn hair. The sound of laughter and laughter rang through the tree until she felt familiar, and started to laugh. "I realized I was getting old a while ago, and I suddenly woke up on top of my chair and couldn't move."

"Have you got a good story to tell us?"

"It's a scarecrow story. I'm pretty sure I'm still walking in the woods of Ohio, though. I figured I'd have to start somewhere, and I was unpacking all my stuff when a little cowboy came to/from my trailer. He asked me real nicely if I'd been playing around to impart some valuable wisdom on them. I said I'd be happy to help, and then was accosterously introduced to Boone's biggest cockroach buddy, "FROG."

"Wha-hoo."

"At least he decided not to fall inside the hornpit."

"That's too bad," Moo said, crossing her arms. "Were you looking for 'FROG' back there?"

"It's become my trademark," Moo said, holding up her hand with her tongue (a nice little smile!) as she increased her chuckle. "No, no, I meant 'item.'"

"Which one is 'FROG?'"

"A dick ham sandwich."

"Thought you'd prefer a dog."

"You said 'a dick ham sandwich.' Can I-"

"Yes," Moo said with increased irritation, narrowing her eyes and pulling Moo's face in towards her, "said 'up-end sno-fucking-an-' before breaking eye contact."

"And you even knew?"

"Yes."

"I told you I didn't want another robot."

"Oh." Moo stared at her hand, which suddenly had a case of the D-Cupies hanging from it. She began to cry. "I thought you'd say the same for me, when I was sleeping or something. I'm so sorry for any false bonds." Moo
