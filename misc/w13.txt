From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

First reported involvement in occurrence: Incident Report 2317-37: "Freddie Mercury's worst thing that happened in the entire Foundation's history"
Date of backup: ██/██/████

Description: SCP-2317 largely resembles ██████████ ███████ as a result of SCP-2317's anomalous property. It is believed that this is due to creation, and not organic origination. 10% of SCP-2317 have been found to be physically and spiritually reverse-engineered from other SCP objects, although all of the recovered objects are fully authenticated. While it is believed that these ████████ are SCP-2317-1 instances, it is unclear if this was the source of the anomaly's manifestation.

SCP-2317-1 are instances of SCP-2317-1 presented in a phase after some of SCP-2317's subjects complete SCP-2317-2, the progression of which is believed to be an exact reverse-engineering performed on SCP-2317.

After the manifestation of SCP-2317-2, any affected subjects will view Eve from ██████████, a female Model-6.^1

When Eve describes how they are the vessel containing all of the Ark, subjects will attempt to use SCP-2317 to take any object with them. It is unknown if any object or human being is affected by the SCP-2317 process.

SCP Foundation personnel have observed a decrease in the frequency of instances of SCP-2317 occurring from 1957 to 1970.
