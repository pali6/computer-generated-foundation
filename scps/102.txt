Item #: SCP-102

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-102-2 instances are to be stored in separate cells. Personnel attempting to remove SCP-102-2 instances are to watch for guards or protectors. After the instance has been removed, SCP-102-2 instances are to be monitored at all times lest they become hostile.

Description: SCP-102-2 instances are a variety of clones of a small cat found in western and northern regions of the world. Instances of SCP-102-2 appear to be identical to non-anomalous instances of the species, save for several differences.

SCP-102-2 instances all possess the same thing in common: "too awesome". Experiments have shown that the instances of SCP-102-2 are able to see and hear and smell the humans around them, and perceive them to be the recipients of various acts of kindness. Although all humans within a 30-square-meter radius of instances of SCP-102-2 have reported feeling able to be moved, or even be persuaded, SCP-102-2 instances rarely ever allow non-humans to enter its radius. However, SCP-102-2 instances have never threatened or harmed humans and any test subject who attempts to come within a 30-square-meter radius of one or more SCP-102-2 instances is.

SCP-102-2 instances are able to speak up to a third speech system, some of which is unknown. SCP-102-2 instances display non-violent tendencies toward humans, and have shown no interest in acquiring or killing those they perceive as objects. They are capable of copying sound and simple movements, even when drunk.

Addendum 02: SCP-102 and SCP-102-2 instances can be contained through the use of Class-C amnestics. At the present time, there is no indication of any non-anomalous instances of SCP-102-2 forming an alliance.

Addendum 03: D-152123 has been inserted into Site-███'s online database to verify the existence of SCP-102 and SCP-102-2, under the name "D-153123".

Instances of SCP-102-2 have not escaped their containment procedures as of this time. An instance of SCP-102-2 will be found within SCP-102-5's memory array, currently residing in the A█████'s collection. This instance of SCP-102-2 will continuously scan the A█████'s database, with the intention of finding SCP-102-2.

Closing Statement: D-153123's containment procedures have been revised. An instance of SCP-102-2 has begun to use the A█████'s database. D-153123 will be tasked with entering the desired password at the start of this section, and will be authorized to access the A█████'s database at the conclusion of the following and occurring SCP-102-2 instance's containment procedures.
