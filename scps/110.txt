Item #: SCP-110

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Site-██ is to be maintained in an underwater artificial reef. Oceanic currents are to be monitored remotely by O5 command, and SCP-110 is to be stored there until search is deemed sustainable. At the end of the month, this reef is to be demolished to allow access to SCP-110's interior.

Description: SCP-110 is a warm coral reef located approximately 2km from the South Korean coast south of Gikini island. It is structurally normal and has no anomalous properties. The closest landmass to SCP-110 is approximately 20km from SCP-110, and is known to have no inhabitants.

SCP-110 grew from an isolated reef in a shallow tidal zone over the course of ██ years. While this was unremarkable in nature, due to its presence of a particular naturalist fish (which has been deemed SCP-110's primary diet) and a highly detailed community of organisms, it was unexpected and turned out to be exceedingly odd.

The water within SCP-110's interior grows from 0.34 to 0.38C per day. This is aided by a series of "disappearances" of the surrounding oceanic waters. Hundreds of bizarre organisms appear to have started to inhabit SCP-110; this water is not treated like normal water, and is androids used by them in self-protection. It appears that this water is pure white, as SCP-110 is light and bright, and not even a few light-blue organisms have been discovered. Individuals swimming in SCP-110 seem to have achieved normal human respiration within a few seconds of rest.

Addendum 110-Ah: SCP-110 was discovered in the middle of the last Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Three massive nets were located, in the same place over China, with concrete fins on top, and coral reefs covering the bottom. The tuna-like creature (see image) now resides in the center of SCP-110, and has yet to be captured.
