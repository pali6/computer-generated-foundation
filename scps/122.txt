Adasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.

We'd like to welcome you, and all your fellow members of the Foundation, to the Use of a Class-IF Communication Device series video initiative, intended to increase awareness of the Foundation's requirements for communication with the public.

The video venture is a collaboration with the O5 Council, the Overseer Council, and the Foundation's Customer Relations Department. In addition, with the use of SCP-1273-L, cross-reference data on SCP-1273-B has been altered to show a known location of SCP-122-B in southern California. This new data has relieved bottlenecks as has been measured from the changes in SCP-1273-B's measurements.

As we, the O5 Council, have put through all the steps this video initiative has taken, we're convinced that there is still time to implement this plan. If so, I believe we can get into the use of SCP-1273-L.

That being said, we know the Foundation has have materialized out of thin air. We don't know if They've got everything that they need, but we know our partners have been here for a long time, and this is an early phase.

Thank you for joining us today to make use of SCP-1273-L. We'll keep you posted on any changes we make.

Love,
O5-█
