It is currently unknown how SCP-142 was obtained. While most of its anomalous properties manifest as previously described, testing has shown that it is also occasionally present on digital catalogs. For practical purposes, SCP-142 can safely be stored on any standard digital storage device. The device must have been designed by the author in which SCP-142 resides.

Pretty much my whole life, I've been that little man who's spied everywhere he's gone. I really, really thought I was doing something, but then, I started to feel like I was being watched.

Dr. P██████: The thing you ended up instead of naturally occurring?

SCP-142: Oh yeah, to tell you the truth, it's just that under the world, I tend to keep my distance and not trust people of any kind. I don't actually trust anything. I've only ever been in a school once, and it was a lesson, and I like to think that I've at least been dishonest, but I don't know maybe more often than I used to.
