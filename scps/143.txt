Item #: SCP-143

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-143 is to be kept in an exoskeleton with a standard human skull at the base. Testing is to occur within a 5m radius of SCP-143, and the area is to be sealed with a 6m lead pipe with the aforementioned skull. Two security officers are to be present within SCP-143 at all times.

Description: SCP-143 is a 39-year-old Caucasian humanoid, estimated to be approximately 480 kilometers in length. SCP-143 is capable of granting life to any living creature within its vicinity. An instance of SCP-143-1 is present within SCP-143, and each instance corresponds to a single possible baby, by chance.

SCP-143 will only grant full life to life if certain conditions are met. These are as follows:

•The 'born,' 'burglary,' and 'relative' conditions are met.
•The 'born,' 'burglary,' and 'relative' conditions are met proportionally.
•The 'born,' 'burglary,' and 'relative' conditions are met causally.
•The 'born,' 'burglary,' and 'relative' conditions are met with an absolute probability of 80-80.

In the following three instances of SCP-143-1, life will be proposed to possible children within SCP-143. These babies will be guaranteed to be healthy. However, in all instances of SCP-143-1, life will be denied to those with any degree of deviation from the aforementioned ratio.

History: SCP-143-1 was found outside of ██████████, ████, after SCP-143 was reported missing. Though SCP-143 is estimated to be of a similar age to its nearest equivalent, its anomalous properties are absent if not specifically ordered by Dr. ██████████.

Addendum143-A:

SCP-143 was discovered in ██████████, ██ by the Foundation after a family from ██████ reported seeing the monsters displaying signs of distress in their lives. Local authorities were called, and the incident was investigated, and determined to be an unfortunate occurrence. SCP-143 was subsequently stored in an unidentified locker within Site-██, and I██ was given a false positive on the aged skull. A Foundation database search revealed SCP-143 to be the same age as ██████'s oldest child, a child now named ██████ ████.
