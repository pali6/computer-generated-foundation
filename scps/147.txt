Item #: SCP-147

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-147 is to be kept in secure storage at Site-81 until a suitable example of SCP-147-1 is constructed. Testing is to be conducted according to guidelines from the O5 council, with any unforeseen modifications to procedures approved by O5-1. SCP-147-1 is to be kept in secure containment at Site-81.

Description: SCP-147 is a French casserole with a base making for 4-5 layers of spaghetti and a top layer of 85% kettle corn.

When served in a compacted tomato sauce, SCP-147-1 will fold open and turn into a five-tier dish that consists of three layers of steamed, steamed spaghetti that will consist of meat, vegetables and sauces supplied once each, and a finish of sweet potatoes for the egg.

SCP-147-1 is impossible to clean, no matter how hard it is served, regardless of how the dish is prepared and where such a dish is placed. SCP-147-1's suit covers it from inside to out.

Upon completion of SCP-147-1, the pot will be strewn with meat, vegetables and sauces. The bottom of the dish will sop back into a pile for the next seven layers to be sop, with the top layer of pasta made with the remaining meat, vegetables and sauces.

Frosting

SCP-147 is to be placed in a dish oil of approximately 1:2.

When served to a person, SCP-147-1 will become a giant, translucent mass of meat, vegetables and sauces. The bottom of the dish will sop a frozen harvest of snow potatoes and a soft-boiled egg with a composition of 85% chicken and 75% tomato. The top layer of both pasta and bread has been studied, including a composition of potato starch and high-quality flour. The top layer of the bread has been identified as the source of SCP-147's anomalous properties.

SCP-147's anomalous properties were first discovered in a food-safety study report and were translated into English by agent ████████ ███████, who is (at this time) assigned to the SCP-147 case file.

Test #: SCP-147

Procedure:

(Informative) SCP-147 is to be served to a PC — the therapist used in the testing of SCP-147-1. After the test, the PC is to be instructed to look at a trade paper for SCP-147's anomalous properties. This experiment should be repeated until all anomalous properties are discovered. The following is a longer and more thorough explanation of the process.
