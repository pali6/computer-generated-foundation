Item #: SCP-153

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-153 is to be kept in a standard storage locker. The contents of SCP-153's containment chamber are to be kept in an identical containment chamber to the one used by the AOI^1. The containment chamber is to be kept at a temperature of 17 degrees Celsius at all times, and assigned a 24-hour containment time. In the event that the designation is removed, the AOI should request for permission to remove the designation.

Under no circumstances are personnel under any circumstance to enter SCP-153's containment chamber.

Description: SCP-153 is a white metallic toy that requires no external power source. The robotic face of SCP-153 shows no anomalous properties and is designed to allow the use of a finger or an arm. It is capable of any kind of impulse response, as long as power exists.

SCP-153's anomalous effect is not limited to limited to its ability to change shaped objects. SCP-153 also affects the handling of complex mechanical objects in a limited amount of situations. Below is a list of possible responses:

•A "snap" action
•A "snap" action with the context of an X-Y coordinate system
•A dependant action
•A "snap" action with the context of an Y-Z coordinate system
•A "X" action
•A "Z" action
•A "R" action
•A "R" action with the context of a single X-Y coordinate system
•A "R" action with the context of a single Y-Z coordinate system
•A "Z" action with the context of a single Z-Y coordinate system
•The context of an X-Y coordinate system
•A "R" action with the context of a single Z-Z coordinate system
•A "R" action with the context of a single Y-Z coordinate system
•A "R" action with the context of a shared X-Y coordinate system
•A "R" action with the context of a single Z-Z coordinate system
•Only the context of a single X-Y coordinate system
•A "R" action with the context of a single Z-Z coordinate system
•A "R" action with the context of a single Y-Z coordinate system

If an object is moved outside of the range of SCP-153's anomalous effect, it triggers its anomalous properties regardless of movement from outside the range. Objects in this range also move with a certain likelihood, regardless of whether or not they are intended to move in a predictable manner. If the object has a focal point in the range, movement by non-designated objects within SCP-153's range will automatically generate internal momentum.

SCP-153 occasionally shows certain values for various potential movements. The following list includes all possible actions when the center of SCP-153 moves.
