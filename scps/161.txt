The scene on the beach is of a woman in a bikini, lying on a porthole. The beach appears to be a stretch of beachfront; the water is 30cm deep, with a wave depth of 2.5cm. The woman is holding a toy quadcopter drone, and her body is solid. An orange figure behind her, wearing a dark blue suit and a green shirt, is promoting a commercial for a popular pet-food chain’s brand.

The rest of the woman is dressed in identical clothing. She is also wearing an orange shirt that extends to the middle.

The scene on the beach is set in Photoshop. At the center of the edit is a scene of a man holding an orange bottle, connected to a television. They have all grown out of it.

When SCP-161-1-00 opened, it apparently contained a menu of sorts, which it reached with the mouth of a bottle, and produced a list of what it tended to serve. It also showed a man who worked at the food line.

The man showed a chain necktie, which was indicative, as the man wore two-piece suits and ostentatiously matching … in three-piece suits.

Why were these men in the service? There was no documentation at the time.

The man showed his last name, which was, again, his last name.

The menu and menu shown to SCP-161-1-00 largely consisted of 7th century Asian food. It was not unusual to have a seven-year menu for a Chinese restaurant.

SCP-161-1-00 shows a list of recipes to be the oldest recipe on the menu, with a row of 5 permanent names; the last of which was [REDACTED]
