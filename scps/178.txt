Item #: SCP-178

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-178 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment facility, located behind Site-19. Upon SCP-178's containment, it is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-19. When SCP-178 is not being tested, it is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-19. Questions about SCP-178 should be directed to the current director of Site 19.

Description: SCP-178 is a black leather belt with a red, gold and purple logo. Famous for its anomalous properties, SCP-178 was recovered from ██████████, ██████, during a raid on a large house. On photograph of SCP-178, it is seen carrying a note bearing the letter "O"

The phrase "O Academy" is written on the belt with the words "O Academy is a Foundation educational provider. We aim to improve teaching, learning and socialization in the para-lunary and earthshaking global community. We are committed to you."

SCP-178 does not appear to be the oldest belt, and may even be the oldest belt known, dating back to the end of the 16th century. However, interest in this belt has led to the discovery of several other belts, which have multiple anomalous properties.

SCP-178 has been observed dropping SCP-178-1 and SCP-178-2 into the water with very high levels of authority. This phenomenon usually leads to some sort of disaster during the process of retrieving SCP-178-1 and SCP-178-2, but has yet to culminate in a "monster-of-the-week" scenario.

SCP-178 is a staple of the Foundation's global education hub, located on the deviant side of the Foundation. Its anomalous effects are not currently known, but it is likely in the future.

Very little is known about SCP-178, other than the fact that it is identical to SCP-178. When entered into a Well-to-Doer's mind, SCP-178 will display a permanent compulsion to complete objectives in order to generate money.
