Item #: SCP-181

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: All instances of SCP-181 are to be stored at Storage Site-██. SCP-181 instances are to be stored in a Custom-Crafted SCP-181 Storage Box in Special Materials Vault-██. Performance of SCP-181 instances' tests must be authorized by Dr. ██████████████.

Any human being who comes in direct contact with any instance of SCP-181-A must immediately terminate them. In the event that any human subject is exposed to any non-anomalous SCP-181-A instance, they are to be administered Class-B amnestics.

Description: SCP-181-A is a "G" shaped glass shard with a 4-meter diameter at its base.

The area containing SCP-181-A is no greater than 4 meters by 4 meters by 4 meters, with a 1 meter radius around the area below it.

Reportedly, SCP-181-A is a little like a vase, held up with an ordinary plastic lens. It is, however, not completely contained, as if it were. In other words, SCP-181-A has its head on the back of a major piece of glass.

When SCP-181-A is opened to consume any liquid, it will fill its leading edge with a single drop of SCP-181-A. The following drop will usually correlate to whatever liquid is being consumed. It is therefore impossible to remove the objects without destroying them.

This drop drastically reverses the properties of SCP-181-A, in which it becomes extremely neutral if it is held by a human subject, and very destructive if taken by an instance of SCP-181-A.

A single drop of SCP-181-A is always removed from SCP-181-A by an instance of SCP-181-A. SCP-181-A will instead display its properties when taken over by a human subject.

Further testing is pending. SCP-181 will be stored inside its standard collection of objects.

And that will be all for this journal. -Dr. █████████████
