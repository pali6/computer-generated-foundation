Item #: SCP-183

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-183 is to be kept in the Security Sector of Site-██. Each instance of SCP-183-1 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at the Security Sector.

Description: SCP-183-1 are replicas of the popular "Velcro on a Stand" toy previously known as "Velcro on a Stand" and marketed by the now-defunct "Ernest" name. The anomalous properties of SCP-183-1 are as follows:

•During a break, SCP-183-2 instances will begin to animate and repair Velcro items in the vicinity of themselves, primarily items that have Velcro on them.
•Once every three hours, instances of SCP-183-2 will take the center nearest to the corner of their enclosure and animate items in the vicinity of it in a pattern similar to that of the toys.
•Following this break, 5-10 minutes after opening an instance, wearers will animate their Velcro items and repair them with Velcro.
•9 hours after fixing an item, it will be reanimated and repaired again as normal.
