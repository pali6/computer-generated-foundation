Item #: SCP-186

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-186 is to be locked in a small container thrown into a vial of saline solution. An inverter is to set the container's internal temperature to -15C. SCP-186 is to be kept in a 1-meter-wide box with a plastic lid. SCP-186 is not to be allowed to set outside of its containment chamber, and is to be kept in a large airtight container. In the event that SCP-186 sets outside its containment chamber, sensory probes are to be used to determine if SCP-186 is sentient. In the event that it is sentient, the containment chamber is to be continually monitored for damage.

Description: SCP-186 is a 5.4-meter-tall (10m) sea serpent currently in canning cabinet form, and can hold SCP-186 in a standard B-52 type governor box. When an object is in the container, SCP-186 will feed a random amount of meat. In the event that SCP-186 itself manifests in the container, SCP-186 will mimic its behavior as if it were an identical target, and will feed the object only until it has become fully possessed.

Testing has been completed on a standard B-52 type governor box. Subjects undergoing an SCP-186 exposure will be subject to being moulded into an infant of SCP-186-1-A-1.
