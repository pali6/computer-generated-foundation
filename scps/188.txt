Item #: SCP-188

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-188 is to be contained in a high-value, monitored tier 3 containment locker at Site-17. This tier 3 containment locker is to be stocked with standard humanoid containment flatwareâ€” tools, cups, and knives required for the safe containment of anomalous objects should they be used by personnel.

Description: SCP-188 is a standard 8.4-pound granite slab in hermetically sealed, cycle-locked containers. SCP-188's anomalously large size renders its contents in its current, beginning state legitimately governmental-grade granite. The contents of SCP-188's containers may be accessed only by opening the top of its container in the reverse direction, to produce a column of empty containers.

When placed in a palette, SCP-188's paint supply will begin to spread its unique paint patterns on any exposed surface that can be painted with paint. If a paintable surface is painted with SCP-188, SCP-188's consistency of paint will be correlated directly with the rate SCP-188 is produced. Low compliance (which results in temporary containment) will trigger SCP-188's anomalous properties, and art materials recovered from experimental testing will first be returned to its original state.

Probe of SCP-188's anomaly is not to be used for any purpose other than containment. Any attempts to use SCP-188 for containment should be reported to designated Personnel File 188-01.

Addendum 188-01: A composite and nondestructive assembly of SCP-188's primary components was appropriately commissioned for the purposes of testing.

Test Log 188-001

Test Subject is a standard-issue humanoid within standard containment of its size and general appearance. SCP-188 is not to be used for any testing granted to it. Any attempts to get SCP-188 to watch, write, understand, or perform tasks will be subject to immediate removal from use of SCP-188.
