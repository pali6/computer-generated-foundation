Item #: SCP-19

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to their ███████-███ status, the Foundation cannot contain or contain SCP-19 without the approval of the O5 council. All research involving the object is to be conducted only with the approval of the O5 council.

Description: SCP-19 is a metal box containing a device capable of altering a human subject's brain with extreme force, regardless of the subject's initial resistance to the procedure.

Subjects will only take the device from the box and display it to a moment before their death. A moment of silence is displayed before the subject's brain is affected, and their brain undergoes a complete cerebral transformation, including a complete brain death. Upon the transformation, subjects remain completely brain dead and will remain so for the duration of the transformation, but possess memories that are not their own. Still conscious and conscious, subjects will not attempt to run away from the device, and will attempt to sit in the same position as they did before they died.

Upon completion of the transformation, subjects will begin to exhibit symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia. These symptoms, while present and often more severe than minimal psychosis, will not occur if the subject takes the device from the box at any point in the process.

While subject's brain death is not accompanied by a complete brain removal, subjects who complete the transformation show symptoms of severe cerebral infrusion. This infrusion does not spread throughout the body, but instead sears the brain. This cerebral infrusion is accompanied by a 'pain' sensation in the area of the brain that has become infruded. Subjects will experience immediate nervous breakdowns upon removal of the infrusion.
