Item #: SCP-20

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-20 is to be contained at Site-19. As the object is of limited or no biological or chemical relevance, it is to be stored in a standard Safe-class locker.

Description: SCP-20 is a small, plain wooden package that has been sealed with wax paper, and is made of plastic. The honey-white plastic exterior of the package is filled with plenty of wax paper, and the back of the box bears the standard label for standard packages, plus a small hologram reading "Honey Bee Butter".

When an individual with Level 4 Clearance(s) or higher is in a six-way dance with or directly witnessed by the object, it will hold them up and wave them towards the center of the room. Any individual who is directly located within thirty-two centimeters of the object's center will become hostile, attempting to end the relationship with any and all parties involved. It will not allow them to leave the area to which they are being direct handed contact.

Users of the object will respond with marked hostility towards the subject for a specified amount of time. There are two parameters to this behavior:

•In order to initiate this behavior, the individual must be in a five-way dance with or directly witnessed by the object.
•In the four-way dance with or directly witnessed by the object, the individual must have already stepped out of their quarters and exited the room.
•In the other two categories, the individual must be in a five-way dance with or directly observed by the object.

In both instances, the individual must not be able to leave their quarters for more than fifteen minutes, and will not return from that point.

Afterward, the individual is to be terminated via an injection of three (3) human waste from their mouth, typically from the area around their armpits immediately afterward.

A single copy of the object has been built in the shape of the original prototype in the box, provided by Prometheus Laboratories. A copy of the object is to be stored in a standard Safe-class locker onsite.

Description: SCP-4098 is an orange testing tube containing a single copy of the original prototype of SCP-4098. SCP-4098 emanates no anomalous properties, and is to be kept in a standard containment locker in Site-19. It is to be stored in a standard Safe-class locker in the Site-19 containment wing.

Description: SCP-4098 is two (2) copies of the original prototype of SCP-4098. The container is identical to a standard version of SCP-4098.

Description: SCP-4098 is a standard version of SCP-4098. It is to be handled by any means used to remove it from its container, including but not limited to:

•Temporarily frozen in place, with the outside area of the container being covered by a layer of wire.

•Burned to the surface of the object, or otherwise damaged by it

•Deformed into the object

Description: SCP-4098 is a standard version of SCP-4098, though when tested it remained partially open. It is to be handled by any means used to remove it from its container, including but not limited to:

•Remote-controlled remotely using a remote override, often within a room or enclosure where the tests are being performed.

•With a control knob to the rear of the object, and a button to the top of the object, with the object being in the type of position it was tested in.

•With a control knob to the back of the object, and a button to the top of the object, with the object being in the type of position it was tested in.

•With a control knob to the front of the object, and a button to the top of the object, with the object being in the type of position it was tested in.

•With a control knob to the front of the object, and a button to the back of the object, with the object being in the type of position it was tested in.

•With a control knob to the front of the object, and a button to the back of the object, with the object being in the type of position it was tested in.

•With a control knob to the back of the object, and a button to the front of the object, with the object being in the type of position it was tested in.

Additional analysis of SCP-4098 indicates that when tested in its original form, it does not possess the characteristics of a human cadaver, and the box has not been opened.
