Item #: SCP-222

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCPs are contained in an otherwise standard-issue containment chamber and in standard anomalous items storage. Only one SCP-222 instance is needed to be located at a time, while the examination is to determine how SCP-222 differs from other SCP objects, and if there is any difference between SCP-222 and other SCPs.

Description: SCP-222 is a set of children's play toys of unknown origin made available via a local store in ████████. The boards of SCP-222 are coated in blue paint. The images are drawn from a box of the changes of the box. SCP-222 is distinctly different than any other SCPs that SCP-222 has been able to produce to date.

SCP-222 has been classified as Euclid. No means of objectizing SCP-222 has been found outside of containment.

SCP-222 was found at [REDACTED] in a shoebox containing an assortment of SCPs. One SCP-222 instance was found in the bag, with a note on it explaining it's anomalous nature:

As this has taken longer than is generally expected of an item we wouldn't feel it's worth mentioning. We wouldn't say it's dangerous, but we can't guarantee you won't sleep in there, and we spent a whole year running it through the process of cutting it all into strips, labeling it, and printing it out. We put some time into the process of stapling it so that it's not just a paper square box. The one we shipped to you is the one with the box on top, painted-the-world-white. Which is not true, because the one you see here is the one you put inside.

Do not fear, though. There are ways to get around that. If you've the time to go through this entire process and an entire presentation, ask your supervisor. Also, don't worry, we haven't been able to calculate what, exactly, would be inside a SCP-1. Instead of taking a lot of time to explain it all, I want you to open it and get it all out, because you're the product of a lot of research and a lot more mistakes than we ever could.

We'll send a note to give you a way to look at your current status. This is an excerpt from the email from [REDACTED] sent to O5-2.
