Item #: SCP-224

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-224 is kept in a standard containment chamber. Testing is prohibited by order of O5-█. Instances of SCP-224-A are to be contained in pyramidal containment chambers, in accordance with guidelines of The Society for the Protection of the Paranormal.

SCP-224 is to be kept at a secure area of 17.5m x 17.5m x 17.5m. An electronic tracking system is to monitor SCP-224's movement. Any unauthorized personnel are to be terminated on sight, within two (2) seconds of an instance of SCP-224-A.

Description: SCP-224 is a three meter tall human male, with the age, height, weight, and year of lifewhite. SCP-224 has the abilities of levitation, and is capable of full movement in one direction only. SCP-224 is animate, and in its containment chamber is capable of speaking to itself. However, vocalization is not affected by movement of the SCP-224 animating unit.

The main anomalous property of SCP-224 is the ability to travel to a previously unreachable location, regardless of location or time being passed. SCP-224 can therefore travel through any living space in which humanity has existed, regardless of spatial limitations. This is not tied to any lifespan or amount of time, and testing confirms that SCP-224 cannot be converted into any biological human.

Any time SCP-224 needs to move in any direction, it will activate, usually after arriving at the last known location of the previous location. This is accompanied by vocalization. In addition, SCP-224 will automatically transform any objects, even those it does not themselves know about, into SCP-224-A.

Instances of SCP-224-A are identical to normal human skeletons with differing visual, skeletal, and compositional features, with a consistency of 40 or 50% of mass; 30% of storage is located in the extra muscles around the spine.

SCP-224-A are solid objects, typically large, solid blocks of obsidian. These anomalous properties have only been observed in a few test chambers, but existing testing is ongoing. The primary anomalous properties of SCP-224 A are the activation of contracts and the activation of anomalies with the birth of SCP-224. A follow up test conducted as part of a routine containment procedure revealed that SCP-224's anomalous capabilities translate to the inducement of anomalous contracts.

This translates to the induction of the desired contract. A successful SCP-224-A contract will set up a series of anomalous properties related to the advancement of Foundation lore. SCP-224-A contracts are typically done in the long-term, and typically last for 50 years. They are generally orchestrated by a series of anomalous entities, with formal contracts typically given to an administrator within the Foundation. They are in need of a living humanoid for the advancement of the Foundation, either a hot-blooded monster, or a person with a degree in understanding of anomalous containment procedures.

In certain cases, SCP-224-A contracts have been used to further the Foundation's goals, or to influence anomalous groups. Copies of SCP-224-A contracts are in the possession of the Foundation, but are in high demand.
