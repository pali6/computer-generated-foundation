Item #: SCP-239

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-239 has been contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-███. The cell is to be built and furnished with standard humanoid containment cell fittings, which allow for the containment of SCP-239. Tools and equipment are to be kept in containment chamber •>EM-4406; SCP-239 is allowed to drink and play video games freely. SCP-239 will wear standard containment suits until it experiences a class-B amnestic, which should be administered upon discovery of SCP-239's anomalous properties.

In the event that SCP-239 cannot be contained, it is to be transferred via safe means to Site-███. Once it undergoes the transition, it is to undergo containment procedure E-294, which is to remove SCP-239 from containment chamber SCP-239 is currently in. SCP-239's containment chamber shall be kept at a temperature of 23.58C until its movement is re-controlled. The current containment procedures do not allow for the removal of SCP-239, although it is permitted to be removed under the condition that it be transferred.

Final containment procedure E-294 is to be completed gradually. However, it is recommended that it be completed by a minimum of two (2) staff members, with the permission of Level 4/239 staff members. Tasks are to be assigned to the staff listed below until completion.

•Researcher Mathias
•Doctor Raymond
•Researcher Nanci

Processing of Test 1:

+AnnoiteringSpecimens,Equipment,Tests
-ShowDetails

SCP-239 must be contained in the standard humanoid containment cell, with minimal use of computer software and live equipment. Test is to be conducted remotely. SCP-239 must rely solely on its own resources, and cannot utilize any mobile telephones, tablets, or iPods, or any other electronic means of communication. It is recommended that SCP-239 use existing social media communications, instead of using virtual platforms or chatbots. To avoid creating a situation in which it is immediately overwhelmed, staff members are to be staffed with existing Foundation sources.

SCP-239 must be armed and equipped four times a day, and may not be removed or stored without the express permission of Site Director Diis.

The quality of SCP-239's containment chamber is to be monitored to ensure proper containment of SCP-239. Testing to determine the optimal locations for SCP-239 to consume and the method of its telepathic processing are pending approval.
