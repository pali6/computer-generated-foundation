Item #: SCP-243

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-243 is contained in a standard storage locker in Site-██. In the event that SCP-243 enters its active state, a Foundation agent is to be stationed at Site-██ and initiate Procedure Jones-Nolan-Nastereaux.

Description: SCP-243 is a gate consistent with other gateways and similar gateways. It displays no anomalous properties and any changes in the gate's behavior will be recorded by an automated system.

When SCP-243 is opened, a ten-meter tunnel is generated immediately below it. The entrance through which SCP-243 is visible is not marked on any entry process and is inaccessible by any other means. It is located on an ornate gold plaque built after the third century of the city of London. SCP-243 is the current entrance point.

A sequence of images is produced as SCP-243 opens. The images correspond to various known gates of SCP-243. Each entry is accompanied by a sequence of pen impressions reading "I guess I'll just put the phoned in agent in position, this one opens right here".

All entry processes involve the insertion of the former and subsequent numbered sections of the gate into a sequence. The original gate segments are disappeared, but SCP-243's openings have been replaced with new ones. The identities of those segments are not known.
