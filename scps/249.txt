Item #: SCP-249

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-249 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-88. Upon SCP-249-2's transformation to her current form, a burl is to be placed adjacent to SCP-249-2's head, shielding it from plasma fire. Area around SCP-249-2 is to be monitored by artificial strainers to ensure no abnormalities are present. A sphere made of sugar-fiber and cloth of cellulose is to be placed crossover to SCP-249-2. Once per month, a micro3D motion-sensor device is to be placed within SCP-249-2's helmet, to monitor airflow and temperature.

Enoobium-79, Petrosthetic Chorus Translator, is to be kept attached to SCP-249 at all times, in order to verify state-of-the-art.

Description: SCP-249 is a pet deer that, through its physical transformation into a hyper-realistic creature, possesses a number of anomalous properties relating to its reaction to the environment, including:

•Its eyes will change color to green with slight green tint;
•Its person has a paralysis in his or her right index finger;
•Its spine is a single unit of hemp, and is fused to its spine;
•Its mouth has been replaced by a human mouth.
•Its legs are fused to its length;
•Its ears have been replaced by human ears;
•Its fur has been replaced by leather;
•Its feet are covered in skin-like grooves resembling spines;
•Its skin has been drawn through the ground by a spiderwebbing creature resembling a diatomid larvacorax, with two molting temporary translucent spots in the middle;

the perimeter of SCP-249-2's skin and skull have been replaced with a mesh of cellulose micro-plastics;
•Its skin has been replaced with organic sheets of synthetic cotton.

No other anomaly has been established.

SCP-249-2's brain has been altered by merging with SCP-249-1, allowing for a completely instantaneous reaction to the environment. This process takes roughly two minutes, and requires no form of physical actions in person or movable Gears.

SCP-249-1 is to be connected to SCP-249 through a high-power form-factor USB-to-power converter, which allows for a direct connection to SCP-249.

Any contact with SCP-249-2 via SCP-249-1 is to be made via the aforementioned USB-to-power converter.

Any creation or use of organic chemicals to sustain the effects of SCP-249-1 is strictly prohibited.
