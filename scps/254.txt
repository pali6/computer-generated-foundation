Item #: SCP-254

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-254 is to be secured within an autoclave at Bio-Research Area-██ in Current Site-███. SCP-254 is be stored in standard cryogenic storage in the Bio-Research Area-██.

Description: SCP-254 is a standard Griswold Model C Avery brand shoe. The object appears to be a sock of blue corduroy fabric in the size of a human foot. No operating or quality control information for the object has been located.

SCP-254 has a single anomalous property when it is worn by a human. Human testers cannot recall the object affecting any humans. All individuals affected by SCP-254 do not use any other pair of shoes. However, the effect of SCP-254 is to imitate a human being. Mechanical testing was found to have made the object capable of producing the illusion of having the version seen by humans.

The subconscious subconscious mind (conscious or otherwise) is a complex system comprised of a complex array of sensory organs. Following a simple pattern of three sequential steps, the subconscious mind is able to form an automatic and (somatically) perfect representation of all creatures and objects which are not direct physical manifestations of God or the supernatural. Any deviation from this pattern is both off-center and inappropriate for the subject.

If the subject has a contingency plan, it is to first include an alternative plan. This contingency plan must be designed entirely with the subject in mind. A detailed index will be provided below.
