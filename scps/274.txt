Item #: SCP-274

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-274 is to be kept in an inclemented environment. The interior is sufficient to contain SCP-274, and has been thaumaturgically sealed to prevent any membrane growth. The exterior of SCP-274 is to be sealed with a layer of argon-bonded wax to prevent growth. SCP-274 is to be held in a sealed plastic bag in a vial of liquid nitrogen. SCP-274 is to be fenced off from access to the outside of the enclosure, with three security measures in case of breach of containment, and should only be allowed to interact with two other sealed animals^1.

Description: SCP-274 is a female English bull terrier (Borgmann's Bull Terrier), according to genetics. Its DNA matches that of the pit bull terrier (Rottweiler), Mac, and the genetics of the Dr. Bright's USB drive.

Within about 2cm of SCP-274 is a non-anomalous velvety plastic door, which bears no identifying marks, aside from the word "apparel" written on it, spaced slightly above a standard silver-tone door of a CVS store in [REDACTED]. Its position within the enclosure is unknown, as no other object has been employed inside it since its discovery.

Test Log 274-1:

Carrier: SCP-274

Test subject: Prior to test.

Date: ██/██/████

Purpose: To [DATA REDACTED]

Results: SCP-274 was born on 4/9/19██. SCP-274 grew up quite small (MICA-5) within a public animal shelter, before enrolling in a private school in [REDACTED]. Approximately ██/██/19██ SCP-274's mother was admitted to the school, and SCP-274 was present. After the school was completed, SCP-274 was officially registered as a member of the school's football team, and attended the school's high school. SCP-274 and its mother did not visit any schools outside of the school, and SCP-274 was not allowed to interact with them. SCP-274 was referred to SCP-274's mother as many times during its time in the public school.

Test Log 274-2:

Carrier: SCP-274

Test subject: Prior to test.

Date: ██/██/████

Purpose: To [DATA REDACTED]

Results: Non-anomalous velvety plastic door was uncovered, and was opened. SCP-274 was able to walk through the doors. SCP-274 was permitted to observe the inside of the enclosure. SCP-274's mother was used to introduce the object to SCP-274's mother, and she was able to come to the door. SCP-274 was given a small microwave and helped teach SCP-274 to open the door. SCP-274 was obliged to listen to this lesson well throughout its time in Storyteller's Animal Sanctuary.

Test Log 274-3:

Carrier: SCP-274

Test subject: SCP-274 was moved to a containment cell within another sealed enclosure, to populate the space with a hundred (1000) new items. SCP-274 was instructed to move within this enclosure (in this test, SCP-274 was to try to move away from other sealed creatures, but was otherwise to ignore other tests).

Date: ██/██/████

Purpose: To [DATA REDACTED]

Results: A pack of Spider's Web was delivered to Site 20. SCP-274 was used to light the candles in the center of the chamber, with SCP-274 being instructed to open one of the candles and peruse it. SCP-274 perused the candle and opened the painting inside (which was used to upgrade SCP-274's computer). SCP-274 proceeded to play with and play with the painting, attempting to repair some minor flaws. It was observed that it was not able to take any changes and that it was attempting to repair his laptop.
