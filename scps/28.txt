Item #: SCP-28

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-28 is to be held in a standard Safe-class facility with a normal-sized containment room, three stocked Safes and a monitor room. In the event of containment breach, personnel with Level 2 security clearance may release SCP-28 to a specially equipped Containment Chamber 2 with Level 3 Confidentiality Protocols.

SCP-28 must be restrained personally at Site-38 until it can be tested for anomalous properties and deemed a success.

Description: SCP-28 is a 6-year-old unlicensed lab technician, currently housed at Site-38 in a CP-44B-controlled lab. It has never been observed to exhibit any anomalous properties. When placed within a holding cell, SCP-28 begins to produce a number of anomalous effects. These effects include:

•"uncontained" anomalous effects equal to the number of times the subject is held within SCP-28.
•"uncontained" anomalous effects that have no effect on the subject.
•"uncontained" anomalous effects whose effects begin to fade over time.
•"uncontained" anomalous effects that have no effect on the subject's body.

As of ██/██/20██, SCP-28 is a failure to comply with Secure Locker Protocol 6, which mandates containment of 800 or more items per day.

SCP-28 has been observed to produce anomalous effects in people, which may increase in significance as the number of items that SCP-28 has become aware of increases.

Autopsy has confirmed that SCP-28 is sterile. A surgical incision has been made into SCP-28's orbital bone, allowing the removal of samples of SCP-28's Gears. The Gears are normally found embedded in the spine and tendons of the spine. Upon removal, they rupture and release SCP-28, which can then be activated to free 84 of its keys. The repair process is made easier when SCP-28 is contained in an OSU-controlled Safe-class containment chamber.

•"There is no need to worry about what is safe or not. There is a Safe-class containment facility here, now that I have peace of mind. I have no other security clearance, so only I and my family live here. No worries we don't fall."
•"After all… lets get that together."
•"It was only a question. I don't think I would die that night. Would it be better for me? I'm sorry. I have no choice in my fate, but I will. I am just a boy. I can't give up this life."
•"By tonight, you will be living in my room for the rest of your life. I am worried about you. I can't know what will happen to you if you give up on yourself, but I will do my best to make that a better life."
•"I will never have to worry about what is safe or not. I have peace of mind, and no fears. I am just a man. I can't give up this life."

•"There is no need to worry about what is safe or not. There is a Safe-class containment facility here, now that I have peace of mind. I have no other security clearance, so only I and my family live here. No worries will ever be made or
