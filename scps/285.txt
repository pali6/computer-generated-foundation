Item #: SCP-285

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-285 is to be kept in a standard containment locker in Site-███'s█ Resting Area. Testing of SCP-285 is to be strictly prohibited by the Area ██ Director, with approval from O5-Warring. Access is to be granted only for Research, in cases where neither Foundation personnel nor any other persons who are (1) 22 or older, (2) or older than 55, or (3) incapacitated. Testing of SCP-285 requires written permission from O5-Warring before proceeding.

Background: SCP-285 is, by its own admission, a very old item, dating from the 19th century. Genetic analysis of SCP-285 has revealed that it has been in containment for at least that long. The item can be made to act as a sort of miniature, if — if given enough time — an adult.

SCP-285 was discovered in ██████, Florida, where it had been in the possession of Sally and her husband Charles, who had been killed by, or was presumed to be involved in, a tragic car accident. During their investigation, while investigating the bodies in their yard, they came across Sally, Charles, and two other women — Sally3 and Sally4 — seemingly inexplicably altered into a total of one (1) adult female, and their other half.

During further testing, Sally was able to use the item on SCP-285 without complications, and over time succeeded in restoring the anomalous properties of SCP-285. The results of this experimentation can be found in the attached file, to be shared with anyone who may be interested, or who wishes to test SCP-285's effect on SCP-285.
