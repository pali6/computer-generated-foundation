Item #: SCP-293

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Foundation agents have established a working relationship with local law enforcement agencies in the state of ███████ for the purposes of harassment and surveillance. All personnel interacting with SCP-293 are to wear Level "7 hazmat gear and wear miniature chemical hazard suits, available for use in a limited capacity. Personnel exposed to SCP-293 shall be granted Class-G hazmat coverings to prevent exposure to the ambient environment and to prevent further lawsuits.

Description: SCP-293 consists of a metal scrap pool located within the <insert MTF copy> ████████ ██ ███████ █████ Foundation Site-████ ████, along with a number of other items. SCP-293 was discovered at the Foundation's ████████████████ ██████████████████████ Site in ████████, South Africa, during the containment of an anomalous pool of static by the ██████████████ ██████ ████████████████ █████████████████████ ████████ ██████████████ ██████████████████████ ██████████████ ████████████████. The materials involved in SCP-293 are of unknown mass, are nearly indestructible, and were used by the ████████████████ ████████████████ A█████ ole█████████████ ████████████████ ████████████████

SCP-293 is an occurrence that appears to occur at random, throughout the world. It is not known whether SCP-293 is an active or passive anomalous force, or whether it is merely an equated physical phenomenon. SCP-293 will appear sporadically throughout all 25 of the 50 states, and has yet to be observed in any other.

Although numerous reports of SCP-293 by Foundation personnel have been expunged for the sake of clarification, Foundation SCP-293 files have remained unaffected, implying a similar effort to keep the public informed of the existence of SCP-293.

Description: SCP-293-1-JP (Alternate Reality Translation System #3) has been registered under the name of "Tamagachi, Inc." and is run by the various entities in a parallel reality to the Foundation within SCP-293. The entity a nexus of various anomalous entities, and coincidentally a large amount of the Foundation that is no longer under containment. The entity is marked as SCP-293, and is to be traced to its origin through anomalous means.

It is currently believed that SCP-293 has an anomalous capacity to "translate" the future into the mundane. It is impossible to determine whether SCP-293 is located in the present, or the future.

SCP-293 is the only known way to travel between alternate Universes in the Conception Universe. This is accomplished through the usage of a modified Foundation Time Transfer Protocol, the Foundation time transfer protocol.

Foreign agents in the Conception Universe can use SCP-293 to access the Futures of another universe.

SCP-293 was discovered in █████ ████, Hiroyasu, when an incident occurred involving three twenty-nine and SCP-293. The Foundation has not replicated SCP-293 anywhere in the world.

Addendum:

On ██/██/20██, Agent R█████ accidentally discharged SCP-293 upon the head of Dr. ████████. This resulted in ██ casualties and ██ injuries. The containment procedures for SCP-293 have since been removed, and all witnesses have been administered Class-G hazmarch hazmat suits.

Footnotes
1. All instances of SCP-293 indicate that they are able to "translate" any future event and set in motion a chronothreat. The exact time and location of this event is not apparent, and all practical methods for determining its location are equally unplayable.
2. Investigations on an unidentified entity in the original original use of SCP-293 have already demonstrated that it has managed to activate its anomalous effect, with the exception of SCP-293-1-JP, which appears to be the sole source for the phenomenon.
3. Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 ("Ugly Ducklings") has been found to have been attacked by a number of other anomalous entities within the Foundation, the Foundation itself being attacked and missing during this event. No (return to containment) event has yet been detected which directly caused the disappearance of all personnel within the Foundation.

SCP-293 has not been located, but any sightings of it have been within the Foundation since the early 1990s.
