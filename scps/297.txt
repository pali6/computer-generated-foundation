To addendum 31-Pozo: SCP-297-1 has written a letter to SCP-297, containing formality and polite words.

I'm sorry, but it seems I'm a rare person. It's not only that I can't speak though I'm learning and immigrating, I can't even understand the words I write. I will correct this thoroughly.

I will update my data records, but I just want to go home and do what I have always wanted to do. Earl keeps telling me to move to somewhere to work but I don't want to move to anyone.

Dr. ████████
