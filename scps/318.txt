Item #: SCP-318

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-318 is located in Site-64. Several perimeter fences and fences along the edge of the facility are to be lined with observation fences. SCP-318 is to be guarded by 10 armed guards at all times. Guards are to remain on-site 24 hours a day, to prevent accidental and/or incidental death of SCP-318. If SCP-318 is sustained or damaged, personnel are to act immediately and avoid direct communication with it. Personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher are to be assigned additional security for the duration of SCP-318’s anomalous effects. If SCP-318 begins to display signs of distress or uncontrolled behavior, or if it does not respond to all commands from personnel, personnel are to be evacuated to the nearest medical center, or to some other area of the facility. If SCP-318 begins to exhibit signs of distress, personnel are to be evacuated to the nearest medical center.

Description: SCP-318 is a specimen of Stenoptera maydynamica^1 steller bee (Apis apis)^2 found in ██████████████, ████████. Ultra images of SCP-318, and all specimens of SCP-318, appear to appear to be a set of five.

SCP-318’s anomalous effect is to prevent the appearance of all copies of SCP-318 from passing through the ██████ Wallace building at ████ ██ ██████.^3 SCP-318 will block access to the building at any point in time. It is noteworthy that only the first floor of the ████████ ██████ ███ ████ █████ ██████████████ ████ █████ host building that SCP-318 was found in appears to be unaffected by its anomalous properties.

SCP-318 returned after containment of SCP-███ ████████. At the time, Foundation agents uncovered another instance of SCP-318, upon discovery in ██████████████, ███████. The exact origin of SCP-318 is unknown, though evidence for the existence of SCP-318 is—there were previously five specimens of SCP-318 in the ██████████ ██████ ████ ███ ██████████████ abandoned building.

SCP-318 enters the community of █████ ████████, ████████. Said community is located approximately 0.8km from the ████████ ████ ███ █████████ ██████ hotel’s front door. One specimen of SCP-318 was discovered within this area. This specimen contained a sample of SCP-318 above the necessary threshold for containment. This location is currently being investigated by Foundation operatives.

MTF-Finality-Zeta-2 ("Samsara") has been assigned to assess the outbreak.

MTF-Finality-Zeta-2 ("Samsara")

Location: ██████, ██████

Date: ██/██/████

Entities Involved: MTF-Finality-Zeta-2 ("Samsara")

Overview: SCP-318 is located in the community of ██████ ███████. The collection of SCP-318 is comprised of DNA evidence of both SCP-███ and SCP-███. Due to the size of this collection of data during the containment of SCP-███, no other Foundation personnel are to know or measure this collection's true size.

Addendum SCP-082: Tissue sample taken from SCP-███ “s plate” prior to containment of SCP-███.

Item #: SCP-███

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-███ is contained at Site-81’s█-███–█████ collection center. There is also to be taken to an area adjoining the ████████ ██████ ██████ Hospital. SCP-███ is to be kept in a military camp on the west side of the ████████ Causeway, located within the ███████ ██████ ██████ Medical Center. A cover story of SCP-███’s containment is to be sent to all subjects. A blue acrylic poster overlaid with the message “DEATH TO IDIOTS’ is to be displayed outside the ████████ ██████ Medical Center, which is to be closed on Mondays. This poster is to be located outside other locations within the ████████ city limits. It is to be hung very prominently on the westside of ██████ Avenue.

The main entrance for Site-81 is to be closed once every 30 days for the purpose of constructing a large, web-like structure, which is to be moved out of the ██████ city limits at the discretion of the Foundation
