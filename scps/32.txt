Item #: SCP-32

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-32 is to be held in a containment chamber measuring approximately 7m x 7m x 2m. SCP-32’s containment chamber is to be equipped with at least 10 LEDs which will light SCP-32 if placed over any liquid or solid. SCP-32’s containment chamber can be tested for a period of 24 hours. SCP-32 is to be kept in a secure container with level 2 of all coating, or with a minimum of level 3 coating. SCP-32 is to be provided daily for the 18 hours of the testing procedure, once which tests indicate the desired moisture content of the liquid.

Description: SCP-32 is a medium-quality dark blue liquid, identical to the bottled water developed at ████████ Portable Ice Cream Co.

SCP-32’s anomalous behavior depends on the refrigeration level of the container in which it is kept, with the exception that any liquid or solid in contact with SCP-32’s purpose will be produced in certain way. The specific direction of SCP-32’s anomalous behavior has not been determined beyond the capabilities of the subject. The documents accompanying SCP-32’s containment protocols are to contain contact information for personnel located in the areas around the site.

During the testing process, SCP-32 will de-manifest into a completely hollow plane, with every instance of SCP-32 being animated with the intent to produce a different response from the liquid in the bottle. All SCP-32 responses will, however, always be the same. During the testing process, this de-manifestation often causes the liquid of SCP-32 to remain on the ground towards the testing chamber.

For the duration of the testing process, SCP-32 is to be monitored for anomalous activities until the appropriate containment procedures have been enacted.

If an SCP-32 response is generated, it will be presented to SCP-32. If SCP-32 accepts the response, the liquid within the container will be summoned, with no conditions to be imposed.

Exploration Notes: During the first test, SCP-32 was passed over into SCP-32-1., who however crunched the words "Have fun! Choo choo" into an unusable keyboard. The resume may be found in containment manual 2.
