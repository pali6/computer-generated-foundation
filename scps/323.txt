Item #: SCP-323

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-323 is to be contained in a storage locker with a flat polyester cover to prevent damage caused by its actions. The containment locker is to be stocked with red chalk and a light gauge. Dr. Knapp is to be provided with access to SCP-323 whenever needed.

Description: SCP-323 is a brown bandage that does not have a band on it. The bandage is invisible and has a pale pink tint. Inside is a machine that produces a formulaic piece of metal. Its innards are black and appears to be made of copper.

SCP-323 is capable of hallucinating objects that its wearer touches. When a subject turns on the bandage, the object is synthesized. This result was retrieved with the help of a few Foundation researchers and a Chinese garbage collector.

SCP-323 was recovered in █████████ ██, China after it was discovered that certain objects made of metal-related materials had been desicised. Standard organic materials would age and lose their color, whereas copper would retain color and function. Five examples of this happen are listed below.

SCP-323 is capable of healing any damage to the wearer. It is also capable of regenerating lost material whenever it is injured. This self-repairing method is similar to the physiology of animal cells, but is carried out with the aid of some special properties.

SCP-323 was found wandering through ██████████, ██████████, ██████████, with a body partially in a suicide note. It was discovered after finding various items of unknown origin in the materials. SCP-323 was found in a garbage bag with a note reading "The ground outside you always feels cold, and that's my fault".
