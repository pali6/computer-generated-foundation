Item #: SCP-325

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Foundation Assets have been hired to track the SPC-90 incident down, and possibly prevent it from occurring in the future. IHS has been tasked with disseminating information to the public about the event, and in the event that an attack occurs, IHS will engage any and all standard Foundation assets immediately.

Description: SCP-325 is a massive meteorite (the size of a football field) accelerated to a velocity over one hundred and fifty km/h. It was discovered on February ██, 2013 amid the wreckage of an IHS-owned telephone line. The property lying within the crater was reported to have remained intact for approximately a year prior to the initial discovery.

Note: The Telephone Termination Protocol was implemented by the ████████ ██████ ████████ Department of Health and Safety on March of ██, 18██. The minor side effects of this protocol were contained by O5-█, resulting in the destruction of ████████ ███████ Hospital's ████ floor.

All IHS customers who have frequented Site-███'s █████████ area library have experienced systematic overdoses of the [DATA EXPUNGED]. Victims of this case include:

•A partial copy of [DATA EXPUNGED].
•D-Class personnel who did not exist at the time of the recovered substance, which collapsed upon contact. They did not die as due to a medical emergency.
•Agent █████, who was stationed at Site-███, who abruptly died in a car crash. His body was torn from the inside and found in the front seat of a small pickup truck the day after.
•Agents █████, ██████, and ████, who were asleep in the room when SCP-325 was discovered.
•Agent ████████, who was in the cafeteria for ~30 minutes, suddenly died of a heart attack. No other internal injuries reported, and SCP-325 was present in Site-███ for at least 40 minutes before Agents ████████, ████████, and ██████ entered the cafeteria.

Note: All positive reports of SCP-325 have so far been posted on Site-███'s ████████-█████ ████████ █████ section.

Addendum-325-4:

Addendum-325-4: Site-███ Guards were notified to the scene on February ██, 2015, shortly after Agent ███████'s death. Site-███ was evacuated for the duration of this event. Due to the discovery of SCP-325 though a significant amount of SCP-███, all Foundation personnel are forbidden from being in close proximity to SCP-325.
