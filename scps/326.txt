Item #: SCP-326

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Research remains to be suspended, containing of the items is under strict review by the SCP Foundation.

Description: SCP-326 is a series of three letters, written in three languages, sent from the house of Agent Milton December (See Document 313 for more information). Similar letters were found to contain the following contents:

Dear Agent Milton,

I have just received a letter from my wife and children. They have sent me a letter to my sister, and will be returning it soon. They are asking for my help rebuilding the house, which they have been attempting to do since my return. I am leaving immediately. I do not intend to return for as long as possible.

I have attached this letter with all of the scanned pages of SCP-326. The items in this letter are at least three dozen and likely more, as if the companies that sent them to the Foundation to try and make money off of them. Those that possessed the letters included the following:

Your generosity long ago, and I think it is the only thing left to do.

Have you any idea how great I am for my contribution?

Rory
