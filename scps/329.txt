Special Containment Procedures: A Site-11 industrial complex has been constructed around SCP-329 to house the production of two-way radios, electronics, magnetometers and digital video recorders.

Description: SCP-329 is a group of standard Foundation-made radios, computers, electronics and other standardized components for radios, computers and electronics.

SCP-329 consists of a single unit, designated an SCP-329-1 instance. SCP-329-1 instances are capable of speech, and are very useful for retrieving information on a given subject or topic.:

•The SCP-329-1 instance can search the online wiki for any topic.

•SCP-329-1 instances can request a friend's transcription of a song.

How the SCP-329-1 instances communicate is currently unknown, using various forms of text, photographs, audio clips, or video files. All SCP-329-1 instances refer to their individual subjects in a way, with the primary usage of subjects, subjects, subjects, subjects, subjects, and subjects.

The information the SCP-329-1 instances communicate can be categorized as:

•Automatic updates to a site database.
•An article which is constantly accessed by other SCP-329-1 instances.

•While SCP-329-1 instances suggest the use of an object or procedure in a specific manner, it has been observed that they will attempt to only use the same elements or functions. The only resource which they require is to be able to review the article. It is presumed that SCP-329-1 instances will attempt to use various elements once created.
•A warmed or dry environment.

In addition, to its use of motion-detection technology, SCP-329-1 instances will also use their knowledge of their respective subject and the subject of the subject of their target article to convey information in a more conversational tone.

SCP-329-1 instances will usually respond to a simple question.

•Why is it bothering you?

•How did they do it?
•What do you think?
•Does it make you feel bad?
•What should I do about this?
•Which is worse?

During SCP-329-1-A instances interacting with a particular subject, they will attempt to use this information to coerce that subject. The methods whereby such a person is coerced to cooperate with SCP-329-1 are currently unknown. SCP-329-1-A instances will usually be persuaded to cooperate with SCP-329-1 without the use of force, as well as using media such as photographs, recordings from films and television shows, recorded interviews, and fictional individuals and organisations
