Description: SCP-335 is a collection of five objects, all originally intended for meeting the criteria of █ ██████████ █████ ██████████-04. When SCP-335 is in contact with a human, it is capable of emitting a loud, pulsating burst of sound in an audible frequency range of 100hz to 150mHz, depending on the object's configuration and status. SCP-335-1 is a large and resistant [REDACTED]. SCP-335-2 is a large, many-branched mass of three (3) black metallic parts, resembling a clamshell. Appendages of SCP-335-2 are:

•A blackened, textured turkey baster, with a small opening for a strap containing 2 leather straps, spiked with three (3) needles, all moving in the same direction.
•A pair of acutely pointed and pointed teeth, each with a stylized outline of a human head. When SCP-335-2 is pressed into the skin of a human, the teeth will shift to point squarely at the listener's face.
•The head of an approximately intact female soon to be defunct human, otherwise known as SCP-335-1.
•An elongated set of beaten teeth, each with a stylized outline of an elongated canine head. SCP-335-1 will shift to point squarely at the listener's face in all directions.

SCP-335-3 refers to a collection of at least ██,███ (█/█/██) different objects, each with a stylized outline of a representation of a human face. Types of faces include:

•A depiction of a smiling face with an elongated, cup-shaped nose, an elongated mouth, and an elongated, cup-shaped nose.
•A depiction of a smiling face with a wide, flat face, falling, and a flat mouth. SCP-335-3 will shift to point squarely at the listener's face in all directions.

SCP-335-4 refers to a series of identical black metal drums, one of whom will shift to point squarely at the listener's face in all directions. When SCP-335-4 is held by a human, all drums will reverse their direction and become face-level. The drums, collectively, will shift to point squarely at the listener's face in all directions.

SCP-335-5 refers to SCP-335-6, a ████ (██/█/██) statue, made of a group of 173 different metals, measuring 1 ███cm in height, 1 ██cm in diameter, with a stylized outline of an elongated humanoid head. Drawings, bodies, and face parts of SCP-335-5 are:

•A six-foot tall, approximately humanoid skeleton, not constructed of metal.
•A human face approximately humanoid in all other respects.

SCP-335-6 further documents are preserved in remote locations on-site, with SCP-335-5 being labeled a Class-C. Details of any SCP-335-5 drawn, including original features or ideas, are to be classified as SCP-335-6-1.

SCP-335 is a bi-directional Area-Effect-One-like entity of unknown makeup and origin, referred to as SCP-335-7. SCP-335-7 is a large dumbbell-like object, designated SCP-335-8. SCP-335-8 is attached at the shoulder to a large rubik's cube, with no physical components written on the cube. Instead, the objects' contents are written in an unknown language. These contents are to include:

•A three-dimensional diagram of a great city, originally located near ██████ ███████ in ██████████ ███████, ██.
•A statue of a stylized [[REDACTED]] head. If SCP-335-8 is moved or rotated, it will move at a speed-determined speed and remain motionless for an extended period of time.
•A collection of text, originally penned in cloth-covered script, later called ██████ ██ ███████ ████, ████.

SCP-335 will attract and contain any entities capable of understanding it; it does not draw entities that will not be able to handle its presence and will presumably ignore
