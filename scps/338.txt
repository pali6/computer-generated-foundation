Item #: SCP-338

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-338 is not to be removed from its chamber. Storage area for SCP-338 is to be kept accessory to the Foundation at least 2.2m in diameter and 8m deep. Testing is to be carried out in a soundproof room with a metal door to ensure that SCP-338's containment chamber is not replaced if damaged.

Description: SCP-338 is a modern rendition of the 4311 Sub-Number 1.7 billion dollar diamond of Roman numerals, Possilinite. The shape of SCP-338 has been changed in such a way that it resembles a piomee, a common form of gem that comprises a series of strands.

SCP-338 spontaneously formed at random intervals. SCP-338 will now form one of either 9 or 9999999999999999's 9 and 9999 numbers simultaneously. For example, if 10^10^10^5^6 and 10^10^10^10^7 were to create SCP-338, then all 99999999999999999999's 9 would have already begun creating SCP-338. The other 9999999999999's 9 would not have formed until after SCP-338 formed.

If SCP-338 is moved, the formula for the number of divisions of negative strings^8 will be modified in a manner similar to that of the sub-number theory, such that the strings continue to carry different results.

SCP-338 was recovered during the death of Steven Kardashev, a Roman Catholic priest, in a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, on 04/02/2018. Mr. Kardashev had been with the Church of the Broken God^9 and had a high-profile affair with a member of the Kingdom of Heaven on 02/03/2018.

3/09/2018: Responding to the request by the SCP-338 replacement manufacturer for a formal GHQ research contract, Foundation agents discovered and recovered SCP-338. The former manufactor or manufacturer of SCP-338 has been accorded an SCP-338 roster and personnel to monitor. No immediate containment over the SCP-338 incident is anticipated.

3/11/2018: Responding to the request by the SCP-338 replacement manufacturer for a formal GHQ research contract, Foundation agents discovered and recovered SCP-338. Foundation agents located SCP-338 in the interior of Site--44 in the █████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████ ████ offices of a PhD student; SCP-338 was located at the storage area of Site-44.

3/14/2018: Responding to the request by the SCP-338 replacement manufacturer for a formal GHQ research contract, Foundation agents located SCP-338 in an excavated unit at Site-████, a storage room of Site-████. Personnel are to contact the SPCA to report SCP-338 in the vicinity of Site-████ for environmental-hazard cleanup.

3/18/2018: Responding to the request by the SCP-338 replacement manufacturer for a formal GHQ research contract, Foundation agents found SCP-338 in Site-████, which was discovered to contain SCP-█████. SCP-338 is contained at Site-████.

3/19/2018: Instances of SCP-338 previously found on Foundation computers have been located by Foundation personnel. SCP-338 was recovered by Foundation agents upon initial containment.

Addendum 033-1: The last known batch of SCP-338 was found inside a storage locker at Site-███. At the time, it was located in a safe at the front of Site-███.

Addendum 033-2: The contents of SCP-338 were found in the room of Researcher ████, who died of natural causes after being exposed to SCP-338. Two weeks after the containment of SCP-338 was expanded to an area containing storage of SCP-█████.
