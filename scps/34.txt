Special Containment Procedures: SCP-34-1 is contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. Special measures are to be taken to prevent SCP-34-2 from being released to the public. SCP-34-2 instances are to only be kept within SCP-34-1 for use under from-an-forth viewing conditions. SCP-34-2 instances are to be fed a standard standard diet of corn mealworms. SCP-34-2 instances are also to be in a mental state of intense distress over the disappearance of their progenitor.
