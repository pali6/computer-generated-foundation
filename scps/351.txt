Item #: SCP-351

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-351 is contained at Site-31 for testing purposes by Security Committee level 4 clearance.

Description: SCP-351 is a collection of approximately 2,500 pieces of computer hardware (which all seem to be based on one another) each with the name of individual sports team or the nickname of a player who has played such team. No current records of the player's other team exist.

When placed within a two step countdown (like a Quikngruvn or Remo) by any player, SCP-351 will display a countdown. Once the player has "charged" the item enough.

Testing has revealed that the gear increases the speed and agility of all affected players. When the item is powered, any damage sustained to the affected player will dissipate, and any remaining speed and/or agility will increase.

If the subject is in a game, such as an arcade or virtual reality environment, every affected player simultaneously will be more efficient at performing all actions of said game.

Due to the lack of a method of testing, it is unknown how these effects on a team determine performance.

SCP-351 was discovered in an abandoned factory near [REDACTED]. The following is a log of the events of ██/█/19██, when the factory was being repaired.

10:14: SCP-351 has been fully powered up.
10:15: None.

10:15: SCP-351 shows a countdown and enters 5. Each explosion has been significantly more complex, and loud vocalizations have been heard, along with a noise as loud as 80 decibels.
10:15: During the explosion, SCP-351 stops vibrating, and begins to display errors in its calculations. The messiah has given thanks to the goddess and the sun to give them a place that they can finally be at peace.
10:15: SCP-351 and the messiah have stepped outside and are playing a game. The light has been broken and the light has begun to spoil and decay. The messiah says they will fight to be free of this corruption.
10:16: SCP-351 has not awoken and has not sent out any commands.
