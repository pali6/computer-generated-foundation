Item #: SCP-357

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-357 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber equipped with a small thermostat and built in a burnt orange plastic lid. A dedicated area is to be set aside and used for study and experimentation.

Description: SCP-357 is a humanoid figure that appears to inhabit a purple dresser. When placed in contact with the surface of a living human being, SCP-357 will immediately refuse to leave the house, allowing the subject to log out of their residence using a keycard. Such access is usually complicated by the method in which this access is carried out. When SCP-357 returns to the residence, the residence will occupy the same course of the field of view as the subject's home and the subject will continue to remain in the house for approximately three (3) days. It is currently estimated that most subjects have three (3) days left to complete the process of their own release via the use of SCP-357. At this point, a meeting with the subject's supervising researcher will be scheduled to preserve the inauspicious nature of the incident.

When detained, SCP-357 displays understanding and function within SCP-357. Command will monitor the repairing status of SCP-357 to determine the nature and extent of the affected area.
