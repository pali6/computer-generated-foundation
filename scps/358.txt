Item #: SCP-358

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-358 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-15. The chamber itself is to be kept as empty as possible, in order to prevent SCP-358 from escaping into the outside world on occasion. Personnel are to not interact with SCP-358 on a regular basis. It is a violation of SCP-358's rights under the, et cetera, to have interaction with it.

Description: SCP-358 is an adult female human of plump appearance and large breasts with full-body, close-set hair. It is listed as being 90cm, and curiously has no having eyes. No other physical deformities or abnormalities have been reported. SCP-358 is fluent in English in addition to her non-anomalous languages of experience. SCP-358 is relatively well-composed and intelligent and has shown to have a keen interest in reading and writing.

SCP-358 possesses two large, vellum eyes that indicate an interest in food. It is also capable of speaking in English. On its chest is a large gem that appears to be a bracelet that SCP-358 calls her "shelf". No writing is present on the chest. SCP-358 is aware of all mutations carried by her.

SCP-358 was a single patient, who has since been under Foundation scrutiny and surveillance. She was diagnosed with terminal leukaemia, which is the same disease as SCP-358. She is currently in a Delta-3 psychotronics facility awaiting trial for a possible SCP-358 type that would represent a major risk of public exposure.

SCP-358 was fortunate to have survived against all odds, with the aid of a trio of Special Containment Procedures, and her possible ability to stop it.

SCP-358 was weaned off of medication and radiation therapy. Its blood is composed of human sap, and when a human touches SCP-358, the sap in her blood will temporarily become active. At the time of containment, its blood was vaporized, but through multiple incidents of anomalous phenomenon, the sap remained active. It has been speculated that this will manifest itself in the event of a containment breach or an outbreak of global pandemic.

SCP-358 was able to escape itself by cutting off its own leaves, but the leaves she cut off did not self-regulate her blood. Upon reading her handbook, SCP-358 deleted several pages on the Foundation, including the index for the SCP database, the section on suicides, the section on designs for weapons, and numerous other irrelevant material. It is currently believed that this has been caused by SCP-358's anomalous ability to reset itself.
