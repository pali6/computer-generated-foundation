Item #: SCP-36

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-36 is to be kept in a standard storage locker. To ensure that SCP-36 does not become a common intruder, a security module is to be installed over SCP-36's containment area. SCP-36 may be kept away from any non-approved personnel. SCP-36 is to be provided with a break room at least 4 meters in radius.

Description: SCP-36 is a 5-8 kg black marble statue of the deity Valkachara^1 with no known anomalous properties. SCP-36 is able to transform into SCP-36-1 at will, and has previously manifested at the request of several Foundation personnel.

SCP-36-1 is a humanoid female humanoid (equivalent to an exact match for SCP-36) that scans a wide variety of media for visual similarities to SCP-36-1. - SCP-36-1

These reactions are usually followed by an instant attack on the individual immediately prior to SCP-36-1's arrival, followed by an indefinite period of passive hostility and sabotage until neutralization.

Exploration Log 36-01:

Procedure: Staff assigned to SCP-36-1 shall conduct a visual analysis of SCP-36-1.

Initial Assessment: SCP-36-1 is a 5-9cm replica of the goddess Valkachara^2. In the words of the SCP-36-1 statue itself, SCP-36-1 is "vital to the beauty of this cosmos," and is often referred to by its original name.

SCP-36-1's origin bears little or no relation to the original Valkachara. It is clearly a continuity error, but it is a viable candidate for the item being used.

SCP-36-1's inception date of 782 BCE corresponds with the Trans-Siberian Line.

Result: SCP-36-1 is additionally capable of functioning as the equivalent of SCP-36-1.

Exploration Log 36-02:

Procedure: All SCP-36-1 instances created, occurring on any of the Earth for any given time period, shall be incinerated.

Initial Assessment: SCP-36-1 is capable of functioning as the equivalent of SCP-36-1 at its present Earth time time and time period.

Exploration Log 36-03:

Procedure: Weighing of a previously established 1500kg mass of frozen snow shall be used to calculate SCP-36-1's weight.

Initial Assessment: The weight of SCP-36-1 is equivalent to 1500kg.

Results: SCP-36-1 has 0.5kg more weight than the previously-established weight.

Exploration Log 36-04:

Procedure: All SCP-36-1 instances created, occurring at any given time period, shall be incinerated.

Initial Assessment: The weight of SCP-36-1 is equivalent to 1500kg.

Results: SCP-36-1 has 4.7kg more weight than the previously-established weight; it was still greater than the 4kg of the Foundation's weight-lifting bar.

Exploration Log 36-05:

Procedure: All SCP-36-1 instances created, occurring at any given time period, shall be incinerated.

Initial Assessment: Total weight of SCP-36-1 shall equal 500kg.

Results: SCP-36-1 has 950kg more weight than the previously-established weight.

Exploration Log 36-06

Procedure: A 500mL funnel made of medium-grade silicone will be used to gather up SCP-36-1 instances. Once fully collected, SCP-36-1-1 shall be used to create a glass sphere with a diameter of 90cm and a height of 25cm.

Initial Assessment: The HP of the sphere and its liquid counterpart are identical.

Result: SCP-36-1-1's resistance to water changes from 195nM/mm to 210nM/mm over the course of approximately one hour.

Exploration Log 36-07

Procedure: A 250mL stainless steel diffuser wiper and sieve will be used to burn the ball of candle wax, just as the SCP-36-1 instance was used.

Initial Assessment: The wax ball is unaffected by fire

Results: The wax ball is no longer ignited in any compositions, but it is still able to produce a fire in some materials.

Exploration Log 36-08

Procedure: 500mL powdered wood will be used to create a light-bulb.

Initial Assessment: The LED lighting has been found to be slightly more powerful than that of SCP-36-1
