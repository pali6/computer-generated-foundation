Item #: SCP-367

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-367 is to be brought to a static state in Site-██, and exposed to a high-speed internet connection for the next three months. A Foundation webcrawler is to automatically locate the origin of every example of SCP-367 and begin to scan it every Monday. The mothership and/or Foundation-affiliated organisations are to be notified to see any connection between the mothership and any well-known organisations, and are to be advised to investigate.

After testing has been concluded, moles of SCP-367 are to be linked to the Foundation through no means, and are to be pointed at all locations as suspicious.

Description: SCP-367 is a ██████ ██████ ██████ ████████ ████ spacefaring ship, which was discovered on ██/██/20██ in ██████, ██████, Cayman Islands. The ship was recovered from a ████ ███████ coastal area.

SCP-367 is designated SCP-367-1. SCP-367-1 is an omniboid vessel, resembling a level-0 dimensional anomaly. The ship's interior is simultaneously anomalous, as it is capable of creating no visible material. This has not resulted in physical harm to SCP-367 itself, as SCP-367 does not possess a single variable, and is fully capable of modifying material on the inside of it to its own specifications. SCP-367-1's center of mass has shifted in the new direction that it had been traversing, and is now located in New Mexico.

SCP-367-1 can disappear into the inky blackness of space within 24 hours. Personnel are to report to the nearest Foundation event management center for investigation.

SCP-367-1 is capable of interacting with other anomalies from inside its hull. However, such interaction takes place in a non-anomalous form, and will not result in any loss of cohesion or experience from an anomalous moment.

SCP-367-1 has previously been encountered in ██████, Iceland and ████████████, ████ of ████████████, ████████████., which resulted in █ casualties and █ ████ casualties among Foundation agents.

Additionally, SCP-367 has encountered SCP-████ and SCP-████ in ████████████, ████████████. Such encounters resulted in ██ casualties and ███ messages and ███ casualties among Foundation personnel.

Addendum-TBA.3-12/██/20██: SCP-367-1 has recently been seen passing through Unusual Incidents Unit ███████, SCP-████, ████████████.

When SCP-367-1 was brought to Area-19, SCP-████, SCP-████, SCP-████, SCP-█████ and SCP-████ were recovered in an anomalous state, and were proceeded to incineration. SCP-████ was recovered intact and intact. Aerial evidence also showed a sequence of appearances of SCP-367-1, including ██████ █████, ████████████, ██████████, ████████████, ███████████, ████████████, ████████████, ██████████, ██████, ██████████, ████████████, and ████████████.

Documentation concerning this event is available on-site at Site-███. This has been recovered and distributed to SCP-████, SCP-████, SCP-████, SCP-████, SCP-████, SCP-███████████, SCP-████, SCP-███████████, SCP-███████████, SCP-███████████, SCP-████, ████████████, ████████, SCP-█████, SCP-█████, and SCP-███████████, as well as the local Justice Enforcement Agency

SCP-367 was found in ████████████, ██████████. Before SCP-367 was discovered, it was believed that the Foundation had forgotten about the ship. Foundation agents were dispatched to recover SCP-367.

Addendum-TBA.3-13/██/20██: Shortly after Foundation agents recovered SCP-367, SCP-████, SCP-████, SCP-█████, SCP-████, SCP-█████, SCP-███████, SCP-████, and SCP-████ were discovered by Foundation personnel in ███████████, ████████████. Several large amounts of equipment and personnel were lost as a result of damage to SCP-367, including initial Foundation inoculation of the area. The damage was repaired by newly-formed improvised containment procedures, which were approved by Foundation leadership.

Due to the nature and potential danger of being found, SCP-367 remains contained at Area-19. SCP-367 is to be kept in a nominal humanoid
