Item #: SCP-368

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-368 is housed in a small storage room in Site-19. Its cell is not to be monitored remotely and equipped with a single camera. Testing with SCP-368 is only to be conducted on set schedule, and rates of containment breach and re-establishment are to be monitored closely, with a minimum of two (2) Security Guards on-hand at all times to ensure a quick and orderly re-establishment.

SCP-368 is not to be provided with food or water, nor is it to be fed. SCP-368 is to be given designed containment procedures, and monitors are to surveyed daily for signs of cases of SCP-368 clinging.

Description: SCP-368 is a 4.4m tall humanoid in its late twenties (30s) with a height of 135cm. It has long brown hair (brown), blue eyes (green), and a small ponytail (white). SCP-368 is petite in stature and 58kg (112lbs) in weight. SCP-368's skin appears to be reptilian in texture. Its skin is a wide cloth-like material with various layers. It is composed of numerous scales resembling fish's scales, and possesses a wide, muscular tail^1, with which SCP-368 is capable of generating large quantities of saliva. SCP-368 does not display any internal organs or physical signs of aging. SCP-368 is capable of speech in a non-epicohazardous manner. SCP-368 feels very comfortable in extremely wide areas, and has learned to manipulate its restraints to perform tasks, including lifting, rolling, and climbing objects. As of 1/9/2012, due to its age it was determined that it would need to be treated with a substance similar to fish oil to counteract the corrosive properties.

SCP-368 came to the Foundation's attention when it was reported to have formed a group of eight (8) strange entities believed to be supposed to be acting as a supernatural force that was destroying, or just dormant, the modern day city. An interview with a group of SCP-368's victims allows details as to how they began their life, and what they are. The following is a detailed log with the victims of SCP-368:

Protocol Type Description
Mobile Task Force Eta-26 ("The Smooth Gentlemen"), on a search for SCP-372's former owners, located after Incident 3816. MTF Eta-26 "Blackout Electrocution" [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-372-1, -2, and -3 were accidentally killed in an automobile accident and are now in Foundation custody.
On 1/10/2001, MTF Eta-26 "Ghostbusters" discovered that a previously undetected, but formally titled entity calling itself "SCP-370" was running an anomalous mobile-telephone business in a shipping container in a warehouse at the ██████████ SCP-██████ ██████ █████ ████████ Carriage Company, ██. Following Incident 3961, all Mobile Task Force Eta-26 "Ghostbusters" members had been killed. The entity now known as SCP-370 is housed in a locker in the █████ front office of Site-19.
On 1/13/2001, SCP-372-1, -2, and -3 were ingested by Class-C amnestics and were found in a Locker Room of Site-19. A search of the █████ █████ ██████████ ██████████ ██████████ ██████████ ██████████ █ Hospital found SCP-372-5, -6, -7, -8, and -9. All were found to need medical attention. After the ██████ Incident a mnestic compound was administered to SCP-372-1, -2, and -3.
On 1/15/2001, SCP-372-1, -2, and -3 were discovered by MTF Eta-26 on a street in █████, ██. SCP-372-5, -6, -7, and -8 were found to have been killed in the same accident as SCP-372-1, -2, and -3, along with several other anomalous entities and entities. SCP-372-9 is currently unaware of the events of 1/15/2001.
On 1/16/2001, SCP-372-9 was observed using anomalous inanimate objects as a form of torture on SCP-372-8. The effect was initially believed to be a thumb jolt, however Foundation officials have since discovered that SCP-372-9 has been using it to inflict extreme pain on several of its victims, with the potential for permanent damage to their nervous systems. The following is an interview with SCP-372-9.
