Item #: SCP-369

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-369 has been secured in a standard storage unit in Site-38. Permission to bring SCP-369 in contact with visitors is currently denied. Following Incident 369-3, SCP-369 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-37. The security of SCP-369 is to be kept as low as possible, and no contaminated materials are to be placed within SCP-369's containment cell.

SCP-369 is to be kept in a single room at least 30m x 30m x 4m in Site-37. Site-37 is to be kept at least 20m x 25m by means of a 2m x 3m x 5m containment cell. No one is to enter SCP-369's containment cell.

Description: SCP-369 was found on the night of 14/04/████ at the ████████ ██ █████████ Children's Museum in ██████, ██, "with a strange plastic box." While SCP-369 was being taken in for repairs, a child noted by a [REDACTED] as "a kind of little kid" walked inside Site-37. The child was reported to have had an office for a child with her full-color portrait hanging by her bedside (note: this was denied by Dr. █████), but her room was revealed to have been renovated by a child in a similar manner to that of the █████ ███████ & ███ █████.

SCP-369's appearance is purely static, and other members of SCP-369 are present, each in a different room within Site-37. The layout of this room is as follows:

SCP-369 is a young regular child of ██████ ██████ who was changed by a child. SCP-369 appears to be the son of █████ █████████ ████████ ████████ ████████ ██████ ████ ██████ ████████, who she however did not have a portrait hanging in his room.

SCP-369 was found crying, crying with no apparent signs of distress. SCP-369 demonstrated an anomalous ability on the night when Foundation agents carried, the Foundation was unable to contain SCP-369.

Addendum-369-1: [DATA EXPUNGED]

Addendum-369-2: SCP-369's whereabouts are unknown. SCP-369 was recovered by Foundation operatives after the collapse of ████████ ██ ████ █████████ Hospital in ████████, ██, USA. SCP-369 was found with Mr. ██████ █████ ████████ when Agent ████████ ██████████ arrived to re-establish containment of the establishment and local medical staff who had been treating him.

The following is a transcription of Foundation agents trying to communicate with SCP-369. It is apparently an error in logic somehow:

Agent ███████: You're not even human!
Agent ████████: No, actually. You do look almost human. Jesus, Agent ███████.
Agent ████████: And the questions keep going up. You said you have no identity. Why?
Agent ████████: "To live with a little thing like you."
Agent ████████: You already got killed by a little thing so why should you be no different from others?
Agent ████████: Almost all of humans are not capable of having very complete identities. Most of them don't have a conscious material body. You have one. It's a great thing.
Agent ████████: You are a normal little kid! I can't imagine what you'd be like if you had a fully-developed limb or able to rot.
Agent ████████: "You are."
Agent ████████: You are you! You make you pointlessly look like a little kid!
Agent ████████: You are a human being, and you have no idea what makes you and your kind a human being or not! Your part has an identity! You have an identity! You are an independent being! You live to make a better world!
Agent ████████: I had to drive off some trouble.
Agent ████████: I had to drive off the trouble! But you never did!
Agent ████████: You made me get killed! Get me out of here!"
Agent ████████: You made it hurt! Man, you can drag me without getting hurt! You know, you like that!
Agent ████████: You've made me drag you out! Force me! Ah! I know what you've been doing! Just watch!
Agent ████████: No you haven't! You're hurting me!
