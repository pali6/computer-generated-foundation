Item #: SCP-375

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-375 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site 18. In the event of SCP-375's awakening or deterioration, Dr. ██████ is to be notified, and SCP-375 is to be treated as a Class-D personnel for the duration of its containment. SCP-375 is to receive four meals taken at a time over the course of its containment.

Description: SCP-375 is a 43-year-old Caucasian male named █████ ████ ██████. It wears a standard humanoid Foundation cover, although it does not have any neck hair on its body. SCP-375 also wears a standard Foundation-issue spartan jacket and boots. It does not appear to be affected by SCP-375's anomalous properties, unlike some other Foundation personnel.

SCP-375 suddenly becomes distressed whenever it is thought to fall. This usually lasts for 2-3 minutes, at which point it will begin to scroll for roughly a minute before calming down enough to formulate a plan.

SCP-375 has claimed to be on autopilot. It has stated that it was unable to think and will end up having a disorderly day.

SCP-375 will begin to make mistakes. When given a suggestion to follow, SCP-375 will not follow it. This is only shown when a recommendation is given to SCP-375. This usually lasts for 1 to 4 hours.

SCP-375 is capable of healing any injuries that it has suffered from its fall and will not take the hit, allowing for a full recovery.

SCP-375 does not initially seem to notice making mistakes, although it can usually act well within it constraints.

SCP-375 was found sleeping on the property of ████████ ██████ ████████████, a ███████ park. The properties surrounding the park were listed as abandoned, as it had been reported in local news that there were a number of armed robberies happening on-site. SCP-375 was found asleep under a bench in a room designated as storage.

SCP-375 was found under a dining table in the office of ████████ ████████ █████, a veterinary clinic in ████████. SCP-375 took the meal provided, with no sign of illness. SCP-375 was admitted into a study containment room, rendered inert, and given food. Access to this chamber must be patrolled annually by Level 2 personnel. SCP-375 was still asleep, presumably resting.

SCP-375 was then discovered in Site 19's kitchen, and was secured for Biological Analysis.
