The reasoning behind the creation of this experiment was to test a hypothesis which the Foundation believed was probably wrong. The only significant conclusion was that SCP-736 was sentient.

Experiment#15, Date:13/10/2015
Dr. Clipperton and Doctor ██████ repeatedly used a pneumatic plunger to randomly pick up exotic media of varying size to SCP-736. After one hour SCP-736 continued to build a paralythic mass and smash them together into a pile of gears. After fifteen minutes it then attacked Doctor ██████ with its spiked appendages and proceeded to crush his head with its tusks. After several moments Doctor ██████ was able to escape the chamber, and the experiment ended.
Testing was ended as soon as the gears were removed from SCP-736's stomach. SCP-736 is to be administered a standard Class-A amnestic once it exits mealtimes.
