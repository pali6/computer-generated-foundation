Item #: SCP-383

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Visual surveillance is to be maintained within the area of SCP-383's effect area once every six weeks by Area-12 personnel. In the event of an outbreak, the area is to be isolated to avoid collateral damage while not allowing SCP-383's effects to unfold in public. Any living beings affected by SCP-383 are to be administered anti-psychotic depressants as needed until the effects of the infection begin to subside.

Description: SCP-383 is SCP-383-1. SCP-383-1 is a large group of humanoid entities that have developed the ability to turn all objects they come in contact with into a red ovoid. Due to the nature of this ability, all materials created from a current source become affected with the infection.

SCP-383-1 will begin to create a new object, which is known as SCP-383-2, at a speed sufficient to transform the object into a replica of SCP-383. Once SCP-383-2 has been created, its properties will not be changed by any means.

SCP-383-2 may be destroyed upon interacting with SCP-383-1 or its effects when the object is removed from the area surrounding SCP-383-1's effect area. SCP-383-2 will automatically become a replica of SCP-383-1 if this is done, and whatever objects are transformed after using SCP-383-2 will have the same effects as their original counterparts. Subjects are unable to request SCP-383-1 to move objects further in their vicinity.

Once the effect area has been completely treated by SCP-383-2, the population of SCP-383-2 will become completely meaningless. Sociologists studying the survivors of an outbreak of SCP-383-1 will refer to them as 'the population' when referring to SCP-383-2.

On 18/10/2017, a team of Foundation agents were sent to investigate reports of an abandoned building in ████████, ██. Agents embedded within a local housing agency discovered the sudden development of a circular space within the collection area of SCP-383-1. Agents were able to successfully enter and leave the area. After twelve hours of investigation, agents were able to locate and capture all surviving SCP-383-1 instances.
