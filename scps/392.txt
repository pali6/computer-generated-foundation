Special Containment Procedures: The social media account "A Second Backdoor" is run by the Foundation in cooperation with the Government of Ohio, the former Republic of Ireland, and the United States government through the "Ohio and United States" division. The account is run by a foundation front company called "CoonTown" and was founded in 1920, by one Eric Yitchewich. At the time, the company was owned by the "California and Ohio" branch of the "Ohio and United States" branch of the following companies, all listed in chronological order of their formation.

The social media account is run by "Agent Smith of the Bureau of Technology" and is established in 1918, responsible for the maintenance of a domestic infrastructure project in Columbus, Ohio.

Users of the account may connect to a private server in the account's main office, which is run by a Foundation front company called "CmonTown." Agents assigned to the account post tweets and text messages to the account, including overt proclamations of the Foundation and the United States government against the Foundation.

The following is a list of all known human remains found in the United States by SCP-392. All of these bodies were discovered in the immediate vicinity of SCP-392. A full list of causes of death and additional information can be found in Document #1377274.

Dr. █████ was found on a beach near ██████, Maine. He had collapsed in the middle of the ocean. She was also found. The third wave of SCP-392, Unit 6, was also found nearby, and had been secured. Agent █████'s body was recovered after he came into contact with SCP-392, and had died in [REDACTED]. One of the bodies found had an open mouth, pointing towards Agent ████████.
