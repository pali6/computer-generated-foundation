Agent ████████: Can you please explain your situation?

SCP-399: I'm a silly, nostalgic, kawaii, self-insert. I play a part, I'll play it back when I'm allowed to rewrite it.

Agent ████████: I see. As far as I know, you did not participate in the event where SCP-399 was found.

SCP-399: Yeah, I'm really glad you asked. Besides, why you expect me to do anything other than write a tale when I can just imagine my character spontaneously appearing?

Director ████████: I don't know if we can find out.

SCP-399: Not based on anything I have seen. I just played a role. E3, it's about to start, and I just want to remember the evening.

Agent ████████: So do you show any signs of containing yourself, or are you still being a Keter-level anomaly?

SCP-399: I took this idly for granted. I only really managed to try and make a little girl dance with me and I didn't like the way it turned out. That's probably what I was expecting, but hey, I'm not complaining. It's just what I have
