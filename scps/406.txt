Item #: SCP-406

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-406 is contained in a standard humanoid containment room at Site-16. All personnel assigned to SCP-406 are to wear Level 1 personnel wrist bracelets. Any personnel or instances found wearing Level 1 personnel-approved wrist bracelets are to be administered the Class-A amnestic and released.

Description: SCP-406 is a humanoid entity with a middle-aged female appearance and a large fallible body with a worn mask augmented by a Class-A amnestics.

Other than its physical size, SCP-406 appears to be an ordinary man in his late 50s, who treats all people who work with him as a friend, and does not insult anyone or attempt to cause any harm to others. In addition, SCP-406 is able to sense its associates and overwrite their memories. He is capable of creating duplicates of himself.

SCP-406 often feels it is in a vast unknown land and does not need to be reminded to get dressed. Furthermore, it is immune to physical damage and can take pleasure in speaking with those around it. However, due to the damage caused by the internal workings of SCP-406, it will exhibit extreme boredom.

SCP-406's current occupation is that of a bookseller, whom it seems to interact with semi-regularly. Outgoing communication with SCP-406 is not possible due to the power of the amnestics. Speaking with SCP-406 is known to take up a great deal of the brain's active imagination, with the general consensus among researchers that the mental effects of the amnestics have rendered an individual unable to form coherent thoughts. The role of SCP-406 is only used to help to make portions of SCP-406's employees produce objects or creatments.

Anyone who does speak with SCP-406 has a higher than average chance of developing an inability to remember their friends and family members from any time before the 20th century. SCP-406 is also a good friend with his associate's name, and being given the name of the associate makes them incapable of referring to him by any other name. SCP-406 will often acknowledge the existence of SCP-406 by its name, but will only acknowledge his name if asked directly. Because of this, it is best to keep SCP-406's assistants and employees of the Foundation isolated in their own offices and in the administrative offices of Site-16.

SCP-406's name is regularly referred to with the colloquial name, Lisa.
