Item #: SCP-410

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: All known instances of SCP-410 are to be kept in Room 134 of Research Site-██ at Site-██. Personnel assigned to monitor for new instances of SCP-410 must wear Level 2 hazmat suits when interacting with these instances. Personnel of sufficient clearance Level 3 are to only be allowed to examine the objects once per week.

Description: SCP-410 is a collection of a number of cardboard insert cards that appear to refer to various humanoid entities. SCP-410 has been known to refer to human subjects and SCP-410-1. The only difference between these entities is that SCP-410-1 appears to be a sentient humanoid composed of cardboard.

SCP-410 is capable of speech and is described as resembling an old-fashioned pillow. SCP-410-1 has been described as being situated in a non-anomalous "chair" by SCP-410, which is capable of telepathic communication.

SCP-410’s anomalous effectiveness is affected by the presence of any type of sensory media, whether or not written, referring to the matter around the subject. The interactions with the subject result in an immediate increase in the amount of cardboard currently in the subject, and have been described as a "putrid nightmare."
