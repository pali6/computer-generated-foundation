Item #: SCP-413

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-413 is contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with security access authorized to non-residents of Site-171-A. A perimeter in the containment chamber is to be guarded by at least four guards at all times, and does not allow for daylight or respite at any time. All staff of Level 4 or higher are to be given Level 3 security clearance.

Description: SCP-413 is a humanoid creature, approximately thirty-nine (nine) years of age, currently living in the mansion of John and Alma McKnight, who seems to have been born a few years earlier. The McKnight family's real estate sales have been going slowly since ██/█/18██, when the McKnights bought a 2,000-square-meter (1,600-square-room) house in ████, ███████. SCP-413 shows signs of physical talent, having shown the ability to operate a few types of machinery, notably the power bed and power hook. SCP-413 appears to have at least half a dozen more former employees on its payroll. Recent photographic records place the McKnights' real estate sales as being somewhat rocky.^1

SCP-413 has complained about the weather, and for the last one year or so has made excuses for it. When asked about winds blowing, 393-1 will always answer with "I don't expect it to affect us at all." When asked about the weather or a flood, 393-1 will answer, "Oh… well, I don't really care."^2

SCP-413 also makes excuses for the weather. For the longest time, SCP-413 will promise not to use high-powered firearms on SCP-413-1. This is an extension of its program into the use of SCP-414, with the use of a revolving cannon to propel bullets. The cannon seems to go further than before, with SCP-413 allowing the cannon to go farther than before, as it was able to push 373-1's mouth open.

When SCP-413 was exposed to SCP-414, 373-1 stopped production of ammunition. Object was still able to move around, but the fires failed to change any other properties of the cannon, retracting and re-positioning the item.

The only threat to Site-171-B is a full-scale breach of Site-171-A, which is thought to be repaired from a gaseous drain, as this area also had undergone extensive renovation. As of ██/██/20██, ICSUT has been offered a 24-hour contract with Level 4 personnel and Level 3 security clearance.
