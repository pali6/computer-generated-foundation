According to 4chan and related websites, SCP-426 was owned by a Ravel's Surprise store, that held several anomalous items. Because of this, the store was transported to Site-17, via the doors and security systems, before it could be discovered by Foundation operatives. As of this point, SCP-426 is in storage.
