Item #: SCP-428

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-428 is to be stored in a box in Sector-64 with no outer chamber or space between. No items are to enter or leave SCP-428.

Description: SCP-428 is a "High Value Item" and a "Shark Mask". It is not to be replaced unless provided with an emergency of sufficient sort.

SCP-428 is made from several different types of material. It is the most widely known substance and has thus far been shared with all species of whale and dolphin. It appears as a 1958 rendition of a "Seed of Da Vinci."

SCP-428's anomalous properties manifest when worn by a subject. Each person who wears SCP-428 will appear as a distinct individual from an unknown group of individuals. All individuals in this group will actively seek out SCP-428.

SCP-428 cannot be killed or otherwise harmed. If SCP-428 is removed from its wearer (defined as tissue that contains enough muscle to allow its sapience to flexibly move with the wearer's will) the wearer will become an amalgam of multiple individuals. SCP-428's ability to function as a device will revert to its original form and their function will return to a primitive state.

Addendum: Containment

Multiple teams have been tasked with containment of SCP-428. The following is a list of some of the most notable teams (or workers) that have been assigned to the project.

Project-Anyone:

•Project-Iris

•Project-Melatonin

Interview-Anyone

Interview #: 1

Interviewer: Researcher Irene Miller

Subject: SCP-428

Interview #: 2

Subject: SCP-428

SCP-428: Sigh. I honestly don't like being interrogated. Knowing that only ten people would even notice the shirt I was wearing could also act as a protective barrier against it. Especially since they'll not even know they're wearing it.

Project: Project-Anyone is a team of researchers that specializes in the monitoring of anomalous materials. Project-Anyone is tasked with finding places where objects of various sizes, shapes, or configurations can be safely stored. The project is also tasked up with monitoring SCP-428's status given it's size, capacity, and ability to open and conceal objects that might otherwise be able to break containment.
