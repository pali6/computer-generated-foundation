Description: SCP-435 is the collective designation for all 217 of the articles of equipment, items, and documents contained within the City of Portland, Maine. They are all similar in some way with each other, and are constructed to produce a single self-consistent lubricant that will permanently lubricate the already lubricant in their hands.

SCP-435 is made in specific ways to create a specific lubricant to lubricate the products used around the site's entire events. The processes of manufacture are well-documented and documented above, although the specific methods for creating it are not. It is theorized that they were prepared for a particular purpose in a particular way, by an unknown group of individuals.
