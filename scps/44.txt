Item #: SCP-44

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-44 is to be kept in Area-███, located at Containment Site-██. It is to be contained within its containment locker. SCP-44 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, smaller than SCP-44's original size. It is to undergo the ongoing sterilization of Site-███'s machinery.

SCP-44 is to be kept in a room larger than its original size. There is to be no less than two (2) large shelving units (C Units). The center of SCP-44's containment locker is to be turned away from them.

Any personnel entering SCP-44's containment locker are to be assessed for possible interpersonal violence by attending medical staff.

Description: SCP-44 is a wooden box, measuring 0.25m x 0.25m x 1m. It appears identical to a standard wooden box, with a name tag written in plain white ink, and a tag reading "Item #: SCP-44." When placed within a 30-m radius of an existing SCP-44 instance, an effect will occur. It will create a "cage" around the contents of SCP-44's containment locker. This cage will begin to move at ██*█ revolutions per minute until the matures through the range of 10-30m. SCP-44 will begin to move again when the matures through the range of 10m. The "matures" of SCP-44 are random, but on the night of ██/█/19██, a white creature with blue eyes and black fur lined up in a square 8.2m x 8.2m square box was seen in a hallway, and considered one of SCP-44's most affecting entities.

SCP-44's interaction with the outside world is unknown, with no outward indications of doing anything outside of SCP-44.

Confirmed SCP-44 events have been carried out in six (6) anomalies. Explorer logs have been preserved, with a random table of names used to determine the number of events, the magnitude of SCP-44's impact, and a "hits" column, which displays SCP-44's actual hits.

Threat Level: 4

SCP-44's physical strength is approximately 4,300, with the exception of SCP-44's power being greater. SCP-44's strength increases continuously under its containment locker's anomalous effects. 1,250,000,000,000 kcal (kcal) of the ball is required to change SCP-44's power, and power production is not affected.

SCP-44's anomalous effects will continue for 55 to 85 minutes, before slowing down. Upon reaching 85 minutes, SCP-44 will stop activating. The final hit created by SCP-44's anomalous effects will be designated as the "bomb" of the original explosion.
