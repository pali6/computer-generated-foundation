Item #: SCP-444

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-444 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at least 1mx1m x 3m x 2m, provided with enough space for uncontained items to fit within the chamber. If this containment chamber should be breached, personnel are to be alerted immediately and can be asked to evacuate the chamber when it is in an armed state.

Description: SCP-444 is a medium-size bronze statue dating to the 4th century BCE, approximately 5.7m well equipped to carry a large-sized silver spear. SCP-444's exterior is composed of silver and bronze.^1 SCP-444 as depicted was made in an unknown material with a surface hardness of 7.8 on the Mohs and a surface density of 19.2kg/m^2.

SCP-444 does not possess a prominent eye. If SCP-444 sees something it does not currently have sight of, the statue will instead only focus on exposing the object to the sight that the observer currently sees. This effect is not entirely random, as SCP-444 will just focus on two objects that have the same relative luminosity (and thus will only focus on different objects). For example, if an observer watches a TV set magnified instead of being able to view more of the original, it will still focus on an object that it does not yet have sight on.

SCP-444 will not display the ability to move the statue, or any object that would be held by it within the space of a single 5 meter radius. Whenever SCP-444 is exposed to a particular object, it will instead focus on the item. This effect is still not entirely random, as if an object in this range is had, it will focus on whatever is most closely related to the desired object.

SCP-444 was recovered from ██████.██, ████, after Forum of Television researchers reported a series of number of instances of unknown figures in the city that they claimed to "see". The site was sent to Foundation custody for review after the facility was re-contained. Foundation personnel did not believe any of these observations to be anomalous and did not attempt to communicate with SCP-444.

SCP-444 was discovered at ██████.███, ████, at a residence occupied by ██ homicide detectives. Upon a cursory analysis, it was found to be a living room, which it claimed was originally used to house various items, including several objects containing anomalous property. SCP-444 was found to be running and swinging its spear, in addition to the majority of the storage room's furniture being damaged.
