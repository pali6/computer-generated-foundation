Item #: SCP-447

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Due to SCP-447's status as a Used object, disposal is discretionary.

Description: SCP-447 is a set of photographic, drawings, and images originally published in the SCP magazine. The Foundation is unaware of SCP-447's exact source.

When SCP-447 is compared to a standard image, the image presented will trigger an autonomous persistent reaction under the hypothesis that the object was taken from a work of art by Mr. ████ or his executors, due to the similarities between the two.

Fifty five cases of SCP-447-1 have been discovered to date, deceased over a period of ██ to ██ days. Recovered photographs show Mr. ████'s work and paintings, which are reproduced as working sculptures on the photographs. No trace of Mr. ████'s work has been found on SCP-447's surface.

The works listed in this document represent recreation of superficial elements of Mr. ████. In addition, many of them display the same garish and ill-intentioned imagery. In his own personal statement, the artist was generous with his memories and efforts to preserve and recreate his work and paintings.

SCP-447 contains the contents of the following folders:

SCP-447-1A1B is the log of an altercation between Mr. ████ and SCP-447. SCP-447 reveals itself to be an instance of SCP-447-1B1, and immediately attempts to attack Mr. ████ with a hammer. SCP-447 cannot be harmed directly, although what it is currently carrying can be transferred to a suitable object by its own means. It is composed of various materials which have not yet been described in detail, including plastic, metal, glass, and leather.

SCP-447-1B1: It is not my place to decide what I am.

SCP-447-1B1: Then I will not put any boundaries on you.

SCP-447-1B1: I will give you boundaries.

SCP-447-1B1: You will not
