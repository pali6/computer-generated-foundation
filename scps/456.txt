Item #: SCP-456

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The SCP-456 plug-in for Samsung's Galaxy S3 is to be available to all STUDIO employees with a valid Creative Directorial Account on at least one-month-end. Recruitment of non-studio employee staff may also be conducted using the account being used to access SCP-456.

Description: SCP-456 is a plug in for the Samsung Galaxy S3, made by █████████. This plug-in does not anymore require an internet connection or the persistence of a virus, nor allow users to connect via their Galaxy S3 to a public wi-fi network. The user interface of the plug-in has been changed to include the system settings of the device being used.

When the user enters into a public, connected wi-fi network, it will be full of capacitink devices that are programmed to run into a public wi-fi network whenever the user is playing videos or any media, and pretend to connect to it. To study effect, the users having access to the SCP-456 plug-in must (a) be logged into the public operating system from the civilisation that it is in and (b) capable of playing any of the material designated at the end of the file.

The following is a sample of videos and media that have been found in SCP-456. If a video or media is not available or for which there is no known player on which to hide it, the SCP-456 plug-in will cause all videos to be converted to a video on its own, with an ASK-viewer avatar, and won't be able to be identified even when video files currently can be played through the plug-in.
