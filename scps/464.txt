Description: SCP-464-1 is the designation of a four-man, medium-sized, female humanoid, designated as SCP-464-2, who is [DATA EXPUNGED] by local law. SCP-464-2 possesses the Sparkle Logo Skin (sparkly blue, orange, brown and purple) and the ability to command any humanoid who interacts with her.

SCP-464-2 is a relatively middle-sized person, possessing a number of static-blocks in its jaw. She is entirely covered in some form of body paint, though she has never been shown to be able to make use of that body paint to blend in.

SCP-464-2 will comment on surroundings in which she will be present. It appears that everything within a 10m radius of her will spontaneously become composed of one of the body parts, with the resulting body part usually being three dimensional in nature. Over time, this body part will shrink or disappear completely.

SCP-464-2 also seems to have a metafictional capacity to create objects, objects of varying quality, from a whimsy to some sort of industrial chemical.

Discovery Log [ADDDEC.3999.1B]

SCP-464-2 was discovered in the Apulia, Massachusetts offices of ████████████ ██. C█████ ████, who was aware of the anomalous properties of SCP-464-1, was hired by ████████████, seeing a correlation between the two. ██████████ was killed in ██████, at the hands of ████████████, and the initial appearance of SCP-464-1 was reported. SCP-464-1 was found in a storage room at ████████████ ██. Due to the nature of the entity, ~13% of the office was secure, and garbage was unaccounted for.

Further investigation revealed SCP-464-1 was actually a collection of life-support devices that were apparently prepared for the retirement of ████████████. Personnel removing SCP-464-1 for any reason are to be administered Class-B amnestics.

Hello, hello!

Subject: SCP-464

When should I report to work?

(Subject takes a drink class)

Gladly. I would like to be able to report to work at 7am.

[Subject shakes her head.]

I am sick. And I am done. I am sick. But I have done nothing to be sick. I have just gotten sick of making clothes. I am sick of death.

[Subject stagnates for thirty seconds, and repeats several lines in her office.]

I am dying. I am dying. I am going to die. I cannot die. My room will fucking die. And it is not the darksphell of the universe to hope that this will actually be the case. The lights will stay on, and the air will still be healthy. The only thing I can do is to watch my body grow old and rot away, and hope that some day I too will come out alive.

 (Subject says goodbye and emerges from her room, limps through the door of her room, and collapses on the floor of her room, where she immediately suffers a severe migraine which lasts for several minutes. Deskett gestures to the floor.)

Uprise. Take these.

(Subject runs to one of the containment rooms and disappears past it. The next following morning, SCP-464-1 is found on her desk in SCP-464-2’s room.)

Here are these.
