Item #: SCP-466

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-466 is to be kept in humanoid humanoid containment at SCP-466's current location in Ilexa, Arizona. It is to be supplied with an active Dietetic Therapist, to replace any missing portions of its diet^2. No television is to be placed in its containment chamber without Level-2 clearance or lower.

Description: SCP-466 is a white male human with the appearance of a 10-20 year old youth girl, approximately 5'6″ tall, with one white hand^3 held by a twig, resembling a "habanero."^4

SCP-466 does not possess any anomalous properties, and claims to have inherited its appearance from her mother.

Three months after impregnated with SCP-466^5, a message was sent by SCP-466 to a computer in ██████, Missouri.

message from researcher███████.

I have come to the conclusion that you are the last person in the Foundation you will ever recognize as being alive. Your mother was wrong. You were wrong. If anyone is in the Foundation they are dead. Please remember that.

The message continued:

You are not dead, yet you do not have the power nor self-control of that creature. That does not matter I will carve you into molds and make your blood boil and consume all your little life force.

SCP-466 gasped in surprise, then attempted to remove the twig for a moment as if to ask, "What do you think you are doing?"

The message was cut off, and SCP-466 began giving other messages.

You are not dead because of me, you are not dead because of me, you are not dead because of me. I have won. I have won. I have won. So let the world burn.

SCP-466 then proceeded to set a flame to a nearby wooden door.

LET THE WORLD BURY

The message continued:

So let the world burn. Do what you will but let it burn. If you want your mother to know that you are not dead and that you are (not that there is much choice after that) do not make eventful decisions anymore, because it might destroy you and your friends. Do not make decisions that might cause you to burn.

SCP-466 then proceeded to burn the door and onto the floor.

Once more, the message is cut off as SCP-466 is placed in humanoid testing restricted to Foundation personnel.

Addendum: Reports from the beginning of SCP-466's containment indicate that SCP-466 was a normal, living girl in a dorm room somewhere in ████, Missouri. Upon interacting with the subject, the woman completely vanished, without a trace of her. It was noted that upon first seeing SCP-466, the woman seemingly lost all sense of self and looked like she was unable to even speak with others, including within SCP-466's chamber.

The SCP-466 has appeared to have been abandoned for some time, but the object has not shown signs of decay, and has not experienced a physical trauma since being placed into containment. SCP-466 has been contained in an extremely secure medical containment cell in secure housing after being a high-class anomaly.
