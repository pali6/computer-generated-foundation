SCP-470 is to be regularly fed with 1 kg (2lb) of raw fish tissue. If this is not provided when SCP-470 is in its feed, it is to be kept suspended in its containment chamber for 24-48 hours without food or water.

All traces of SCP-470-1 have been excised from the bloodstreams of all subjects within a 1km radius of the test subject at the time of testing. The test subject has developed a compulsion to leave the test chamber by any means necessary in order to proceed with the procedure.

SCP-470-1 is not aware of any other individuals within a visible distance of it. No records have been found of SCP-470-1's childhood, and its parents have not been located. SCP-470-1 is not aware of any relatives who might even know about him. Note: SCP-470-1 had requested this privilege. - Dr. Boland
