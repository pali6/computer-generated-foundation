Item #: SCP-480

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-480 (formerly known as Bill 78.42) is to be kept securely locked in a Water Horse Storage Area (3m x 3m x 3m) at Site-88. Access with any means must be approved by a Level 2 researcher.

Description: SCP-480 is an object of no particular rank. It is colorless and non-reptilian, and possesses no special properties either.

SCP-480 is just an old water horse (a "water horse" is a creature of the same name). It costs roughly $1000 per hour of labor, and is durable enough to run on any amount of water (referred to as the "water"). It will appear to consume the living water it is created from, but will not consume anything else.

SCP-480's ability to create water will give it this effect: Tides will flow continuously for the duration of the event and will never turn into non-existent water. However, it can turn into a similar, non-reptilian form of water. Under normal circumstances no color will be observed, but in an event contaminated by SCP-480 it will be colored "red". Note that the color of water will be red when already in the human form.

SCP-480 and its specific form of water will change depending on the color of the water given to SCP-480. If an unidentified substance is put in water, SCP-480 will revert to its original color. If a non-human substance is put in water, SCP-480 will revert to its original color.

SCP-480 will affect the nature of any living being in the vicinity, however, this effect only affects living organisms with solid bodies attached to them.
