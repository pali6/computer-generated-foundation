Item #: SCP-486

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Aside from the book, non-restricted access to SCP-486 is to be granted for testing purposes.

Description: SCP-486 is a collection of two hundred and thirty-seven IMLS books, each containing twenty-one pages and twenty-three pages of insert tips. When not in use, these tips are to be replaced in turn with various tacks. This is done so long as the book is in storage and promptly erased if any of these tips are nearly done.

SCP-486 has been known to track the progress of any person attempting to read any of the books. Once the person has completed reading one of the books, it will begin to track individual points of view. After reading an entire book^1, SCP-486 will hold associated points of view and will continue to track these points of view until the person chooses to delete the book. Once the subject has stopped reading, SCP-486 will have no more associated points of view.

The only distinguishing characteristic of the book is the absence of any notes, annotations, or pages, as well as a cover page that is completely blank. This instance of the book is randomly drawn during shipping.

All activities performed for SCP-486 are to be recorded in the ██████ █████ ████████ █ ████ ████████ ████████████ ████ ████████ ██████ ████ ██████ ████████ ██ ████████ ████████ █████ ██ █████ ████████████ ████████████, and photographed immediately afterward.

Addendum A: Incident o██████ 01/██/1998
The ███████ ██ ████████ ███ Incident was a mass suicide in the ███████ ████████████ ██████ █████████, which resulted in the death of ███████ ████ ████████ and ███████ ███████ ██████. The following is a letter written by ████████ █████, ███████ ██████ ████████ ████████████. ████████ ████████ ████████████ was the victim of this event.

███████ ████████ █████ ████████ shall be one of the first to die, and yet, the fountain has never opened. The sun is setting and, though we are in the twilight zone, yet we must get up and get moving. The only way to get up is to roll up my sleeves and crawl under the dirt. At least I can look forward to tomorrow because I'll never have the sun out, but it is surely getting colder. Now that I think about it, I could write a piece with the subject amassing my strength and running through SCP-███. I imagine it to be a game of poking the most sensitive parts of SCP-███ into my head to decide which way I'll go. This game might also be a choice between getting up and running or getting up and putting my foot down. Regardless, we must make this point: I'll go with the game. I'll run through SCP-███ first. I'll run through SCP-███ second, but I'll leave the best book I have with me: the book I always keep with me. I'll run through SCP-███ third. SCP-███ fourth. SCP-███ fifth. SCP-███ sixth. Finally, I'll run through my foot, checking to make sure there are no bloodstains on it. If there are, I'll run through SCP-███, which I believe will be the least painful.

A loud, rumbling sound is heard before SCP-███ fills the object with blood. Immediately after, SCP-███ violently shatters on the ground. SCP-███ promptly falls into a crouch, and five small-scale replicas of SCP-███ spontaneously appear about a meter from them. These replicas proceed to attack SCP-███, thereby making all of it bleed. SCP-███ produces a scrap of paper, the title "The Handbook for the Study of the Paranormal", which is ejected to one of the replicas. The first replica opens fire on its sister replicas, but, despite the threat, the previous three replicate by its length of assistance have been dismembered. All instances of SCP-███ are then removed from the object, and its owner is then instructed to "back" the process. However, the owner of a copy of SCP-███ instead consist of a single miniature version of the sixteen previous instances. Similar instances of SCP-███ appear shortly afterwards, mimicking two of the previous replicas in combat. We have been able to determine that, by the time this process is in full effect, SCP-███ will be
