Item #: SCP-49

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-49 is to be kept in a containment vault at Site 17. SCP-49 can be given up to D-class subject D-54196-M-02; D-54196-M-02 must undergo full field evaluation with appropriate consideration for SCP-49's containment procedures. Subject must be measured at D-54196-M-02's lowest velocity; if she is under D-54196-M-02's effective mass, she must be returned to containment. Please report any deviations to Security Director ███████-███.

Description: SCP-49 seems to have a preference for bicycles. At random intervals, it will transport a number of bicycles to an unknown location, and will either pick them up, or deliver them to an unknown location. It also has a preference for beverages. Subject has stated that they have met all high-sec personnel in their entire career, on average. Subject has also stated that they are going to be on ██ occasions.

Test Log 4946-A: Subject D-54196-M-02, D-54196-M-02's full name, has the following anomalous properties.

In case of injury (which is not a physical injury), SCP-49 will take a bicycle, turn it into a kysel, and transport it to the true location.

In case of death (or other cause of death), SCP-49 will transport a kysel to the current location of subject D-54196-M-02. Subject will undergo at least ████ full field evaluation to determine whether or not the anomalies described in Test Log 4946-A are truly present. If found to be the case, SCP-49 will return a number of bicycles to the location of the person who initiated these anomalous effects, while leaving no notes in the location.

Subject shows no indication of illness or any underlying mental health issues; the factors that correlate with excessive exposure to the anomalous effects of SCP-49 include a high index of pyruvate in the urine, a high tendency to abuse substances and overuse of tobacco, and a high rate of recreational drug use.

Test Log 4946-B: Subject D-54196-M-02, D-54196-M-02's complete name, has the following anomalous properties.

In case of injury (which is not a physical injury), SCP-49 will take a bicycle, turn it into a kysel, and transport it to the location of subject D-54196-M-02.

In case of death (or other cause of death), SCP-49 will transport a kysel to the location of the person who initiated these anomalous effects.

Subject shows no indication of illness or any underlying mental health issues; the factors that correlate with excessive exposure to the anomalous effects of SCP-49 include a high index of pyruvate in the urinary tract, a high tendency to abuse substances and overuse of tobacco, and a high rate of recreational drug use.

Test Log 4946-C: Subject D-54196-M-02, D-54196-M-02's complete name, has the following anomalous properties.

In case of injury (which is not a physical injury), SCP-49 will take a bicycle, turn it into a kysel, and transport it to the location of subject D-54196-M-02.

In case of death (or other cause of death), SCP-49 will transport a kysel to the location of the person who initiated these anomalous effects.

Subject's age is consistent with being between 40 and 45, and subject's appearance matches that of [REDACTED]. Subject's stated age is consistent with being between 24 and 25, and subject's sex matches that of a female between the ages of 18 and 19.
