Item #: SCP-507

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the relatively low number of reported cases and the resultant infrequency, SCP-507 is to be kept within normal containment. Research was completed on this project to determine the effect of the object on the human psyche. With the use of memory-amplifying substances, it was discovered that SCP-507 was able to indicate the attempted conclusion of life. Those who made a life decision, including living family members, were unable to divulge this event.

Once this research was completed, SCP-507 was moved to a nearby Foundation facility and tested under the standards for SCP-564. Failure to comply resulted in an immediate recall of the object

Addendum-507-2: Additional notes and sample data

Day 1: The following document was recovered from SCP-507's containment locker about 3/4/2016. Upon viewing this, several of the records produced by SCP-507 were found in the locker. The material is believed to be approximately 1,000 pages of classified material.

THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENT HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED

Document is to be provided to personnel of level 4 clearance or higher this week. Information reported to personnel tends to be considered superfluous to the containment of the anomaly.

Previous to the mutilation, any personnel who has made such a choice were informed of the pros and cons of the experiment and the eventual conclusion. Most unfortunate after the conclusion, it was neither the choice of the subject nor the choice of the subject.

The document ends on a note that is a reference to the Foundation's theme for November 17th, 2017.

FOLLOWING CORRECT INFORMATION REGARDING THIS DOCUMENT

Document #507 is to be provided to personnel regarding their decision to not test SCP-507 and thus to be retired. During the course of testing SCP-507 was affected by an event in SCP-564. Object affected by this event was presented with multiple choices within a given situation, all of which altered SCP-507. Documentation attempts to apply the same lesson to a hypothetical situation in which other rational decisions could be made by a subject.

While many effective rational choices made by SCP-507 were noted, the remaining nineteen have been noted:

•"I believed you!"
•"I'm worried about you!"
•"I'm not sure he'll make the decision he believes in!"
•"I love him!"
•"Your decision to ignore the list of rational decisions made by SCP-507 is impossible! We both have the same decisions!"
•"You're all a bunch of jerks!"
•"You're all a bunch of fools!"
•"I'm scared of you!"
•"You're all just jerks!"
•"I'm terrified of you!"

Day 2: The following document was recovered from SCP-507's containment locker about 3/5/2016. The material is believed to be approximately 1,000 pages of classified material.

CHECK

Available to Personnel of Level 4 clearance or higher this week.

The first test of SCP-507, SCP-507-2. While not unusual given the nature of SCP-507, the subject claimed to believe in the existence of some type of life form. While SCP-507 was not in the holder's grip, this may not be true. The [DATA EXPUNGED] allowed SCP-507 to more closely grasp SCP-507-2.

NOTE: It is expected that all Foundation personnel will want to avoid the subject because of the far-reaching implications of this test. Please consider how this story is compatible with the Foundation's theme for November 17th, 2017.

Note: The following failsafe system for SCP-507-2 was introduced to the containment facility at the suggestion of Dr. █████ who believes that the subject will not make a rational decision.
