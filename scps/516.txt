Item #: SCP-516

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-516 is to be kept on a pedestal in a boarding area at Site 40-J. The maintenance of the pedestal is to be renewed once per month. Monitoring of the pedestal is not authorized because of the potential risk of a containment breach.

Description: SCP-516 is a inanimate brass , brass mache-headed and 12" square bronze statue, originally believed to have been manufactured in the 18th century. SCP-516 will appear in any building in the city it will hit, in a square being used for seating.

SCP-516 does not emit any sound, and emits no sound when hit. SCP-516 will remain in this state indefinitely until it is directly hit by a stranger's hand. SCP-516 will then move forward on its feet through the center of a seating area until it hits a surface. This will occur at a distance of approximately 2m from the original location of the impact. SCP-516 will then exit the seating area. Determined instances of SCP-516 are inactive.

The appearance of SCP-516 is directly proportional to the weight of the person who damaged SCP-516 with their hand. For example, if 582 was a 3m note of 25g, and hit SCP-516 directly in an open area, the light emitted from SCP-516 would be directly proportional to the weight of the person who hit it.

Interactions between Foundation personnel and SCP-516 have been documented:

•Infection with SCP-439 and other common phobias.
•Reputable hard to keep people away, especially in areas with an abundance of shops and businesses.

See Test Log for more details.
