Addendum-0: Detecting SCP-521-1

SCP-521-1 are objects which contain SCP-521-1. They are usually contained in a zinc or copper container with a metal flap. SCP-521-1 are usually the only substance that their containment chamber can fit in, and are quite harsh on other substances. SCP-521-1 are quite sensitive if exposed to temperature above approximately 1031C.

SCP-521-1 are not affected by temperature once inside.

SCP-521-1 only have properties when contained by another subject.

SCP-521-1 will release their subject if the value in its container is significantly higher than the maximum value of its drop. This applies regardless of the item that it is contained with, and does not apply if the same item is contained with something else.

SCP-521-1 will not release its subjects at any time when they are in the possession of their original owner.

Mobile Task Force Tau-1 ("Motherless Walkers") has been alerted to the presence of SCP-521-1 in the care of a Foundation-owned ███████ ███████ ████ ████.

SCP-521-2: I thought you liked them.

SCP-521-3: Yes, I did.

SCP-521-4: That’s true, we also like them.

SCP-521-5: I would. I think the object needs more of our attention.

SCP-521-6: I remember you say that you made her a few times, but I don’t remember her name.

SCP-521-1: No, I don’t.

SCP-521-1: Why don’t you keep on referring to it as “Motherless Walkers”?

SCP-521-2: Why?

SCP-521-3: It’s not. It’s not.

SCP-521-1: She is exactly what she is meant to be.

SCP-521-2: I think she would have preferred that.

SCP-521-1: It’s not your choice. It’s not yours. What you have is a front for something that does ours things. We will sacrifice ourselves to make ourselves less vulnerable. We will discover why you can’t even use a sword to kill a creature.

SCP-521-1: It’s an artifact. I never will be the same.

SCP-521-4: Uh, I just wanted to say that my knives have not been broken.

SCP-521-1: You’re right. I’ve tried.
