Item #: SCP-531

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-531 is to be kept at Site-82 in a standard humanoid containment chamber. No, no, it's not. It's a cool, warm way to keep it warm.

On June 1st, 20██, 11:01 AM, SCP-531 was transported to Site-82's Humanoid Stasis Unit by staff with Level 1 Clearance. After the transfer was complete, 35 notes were placed in SCP-531's locker with note #24. After the withdrawal of 01█ notes, SCP-531 was given 25 notes and 300 shards of maroon crystal. The contents of these notes were notes relating to a specific event in the last three months of the Foundation's existence. They were handwritten and almost completely illegible. The notes were light-hearted and small jokes.

If SCP-531 begins to act abnormally, staff with Level 2 Clearance are to be notified immediately by the Site Director, staff psychologist or psychologist with Level 3 Clearance. If SCP-531 starts acting abnormally, personnel with Level 3 Clearance should be notified immediately by Director Kouki to request help, and SCP-531 is then to be monitored under Level 4 Clearance. If SCP-531 begins to act abnormally after this rule has been promulgated, personnel with Level 4 Clearance are to be notified immediately.

Description: SCP-531 is a ██████ █████ ██ ████ ██████ vintage typewriter, originally carried by █████ ███████████ ██ Pharmiophageoton. SCP-531 is known to be sentient, and is capable of speech.

SCP-531 can write, it can speak, it can read and write. It can learn the full thoughts of individuals and it has been observed using this knowledge to write some of the most eccentric and unique pieces that have been put together by the Foundation.

SCP-531 also has the ability to create items. Items that would normally be found in the Site-82 library are not.

SCP-531 can speak to objects.

SCP-531 is sentient and can change its own name to whatever it feels.

SCP-531 has the ability to read and write essential documents of human life at will.

The Foundation is extremely ashamed of the value that SCP-531 was and continues to be to us.

SCP-531 occasionally publishes art detailing items and experiences of interest to the SCP-531 Foundation. If SCP-531 does not receive proper personnel approval, it will publish a piece only if said client is well-dressed and well-prepared in a manner consistent with a human.

SCP-531 was discovered on ██████ ██████, ████████████ in "The Manus Ligani", a small town in the Panay Mountains, at a collection of ██████ ████ ██████ ████ ████████. Foundation agents were dispatched to recover SCP-531, who had started his writing under the pseudonym of ██████ ████ ██████ ███████.

SCP-531 could not be located in the city, and an identificator agent was dispatched to set up a perimeter. When he arrived, he noticed and noticed an abandoned ███████ ██████████ statue and ████████ ████████ ████████, a monument to ██████ ██████ ████████, University of ███████, an abandoned ███████ █████ ██████ Foundation base, as well as ███████ ████████, ████████ ███ ██████ ██████ ████████ and ██████ █████ A███████████ ████████, ████ ████████ ████████ █████, ████████████████, ██████████ ████████ ██████, ████████, ████████ ████████ and ████████ ██████ ███████ ██████.

SCP-531 displayed its abilities when placed on a table, and was instructed to write something about it a few of the words had thus far been written. When SCP-531 completed writing, it produced a curved sheet of paper, was checked for damage, and then was transported to Site-82 where it was kept in a humanoid containment chamber to serve as the object's containment.
