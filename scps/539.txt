Description: SCP-539 is a subject of indeterminate age described by most known witnesses as having three pairs of nails. The entirety of SCP-539’s body, except for the eyes, ears, and hair, is a mass of skeletal muscle, particularly the lower limbs and lower spine. The skeletal structure is made up of small, insubstantial spaces, and is directed at the subject’s head and neck through various muscles. These muscles have yet to be discovered, as the subject’s joints seem to have no movement of their own or which would be necessary to produce any of them internally. SCP-539’s eyes appear to be a single strand of bone, and the only visible surface is the epidermis,[DATA EXPUNGED]. Despite the appearance of paint-like fur, no melanin has been found, nor are the hairs in the subject’s skin.

Abdomen of SCP-539 is rounded, shapely, smooth, and long, beady-colored tentacles. The flesh of SCP-539 is of varying consistency and color, but almost all of it is red.
