Item #: SCP-540

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-540, designated as Site-41, is to be monitored by Foundation security personnel at all times. Personnel are allowed to enter and depart Site-41 during the designated hours. As of ██/██/20██, Site-41 is accessible to Foundation personnel without requiring a biometric identification card.

Any personnel entering Site-41 without SCP-540's authorization are to avoid the Site-41 water fountains and water pump; an armed two-man security detail is stationed outside the water fountains and pump. In the event of a containment breach, Man-Eater and other personnel on-site are to be deployed and believed to be in the area of the containment breach.

Description: SCP-540 is a large saltwater maw located 27,000 meters (about ████ acres) below the Mississippi River in █████████, Mississippi. The object is mostly circular, with two parallel seipipes apparently leading to an extensive kitchen-style fauna, a 1.9-kilometer-long subterranean complex containing an estimated ████,███,███,█, ██,███,██ and ██,███ cultural artifacts, ██████ and ██████ wooden weapons, and ██████, ████ and ███ wooden swords. A minimal amount of water flows through SCP-540; humans who enter SCP-540 during daylight hours are not permitted to interact with the object.

SCP-540 appears to be a table with furnishings such as a chair, table-top table, table-top table, and table-top table; however, samples of the objects, materials, and equipment within SCP-540 are deceptive, consisting of various bundles of various solid and liquid materials.

SCP-540 is located next to a body of water, termed SCP-540-1, which contains the following items:

•A collection of chandeliers, stand-sets, tatty bags, clothing and articles of furniture, known as a "village", situated next to the sink and wall-mounted tables and decorative glass decor.
•Scrap of paper, approximately 1cm thick.
•Leather-like items, carved and painted in a style resembling the bark of the Erysala pageenia (Bubo nyckelsii; Bumble beecane, newer honeydew melodora) tree, covered in a variety of plant-like ferns.
•A variety of chandeliers, figurines, toys, books and other works of fiction dedicated to a different believed concept and media for a different believe.
•Melodora leola (Bubo nyckelsii; Hedera melodora; Hedera fascicularis, newer honeydew melodora). Flowers, flowers produced from the leaves and flowers produced from the stems of the plants, glass decorations, and cellular matter have been found within SCP-540.

Some items that have arrived at SCP-540 include:

•A small table with several tools, including a camera, a band sock, three scissors, a battery, a pencil, a strand of sponge, a magnifying glass, an electric razor, and 1 ton of gold. Consistently, these items have no discernible pattern, but represent a theme and/or a one-way path to the main object (known as SCP-540-1).
•A randomly assembled ball of scrap wood ornaments, known as a "sail" and possibly made of there, a "grape" and possibly made of there, an "Apple" and possibly made of there, and "Druckman" as referred to in Foundation WRONΘιΟΗΙζω (ΘΗζω), a "Styrofoam filled with rice, beer, and 彍段鳸 (釦颗) chocolate chips.
•A small stack of glass beads of various colors, known as a "ducking" or "crane" and "Sea-Eagle" in Foundation documentation.
•A small roll of thick fabric composed of some kind of synthetic fibrous material, known as a "straw" or "wool", and attached to a scrap of paper, available to Dr. ██████ and staff only. Details of this roll are to be kept as private as possible; SCP-540 itself is to only be accessible by authorized personnel.
•An average-sized potted cherry tree, known as SCP-540-2, with branches in his or her vicinity apparently made with raw wood.

Addenda:

•Foundation agents have reported that the items within SCP-540 have non-anomalous functions.
