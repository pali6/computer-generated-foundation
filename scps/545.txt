Item #: SCP-545

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-545 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit. A direct liaison is to be maintained between SCP-545 and the supervising researcher at Site-75. The liaison is to be always accompanied by three armed security guards at all times.

Description: SCP-545 is the representative of SCP-545-01 (contact with SCP-545-1 has been confirmed to result in clinical deterioration due to prolonged exposure to the substance), an entity that does not appear in the photographs of SCP-545. SCP-545 possesses two apparently mutually exclusive morphogenetic capabilities, which allow SCP-545 to take control of objects it was not previously capable of modifying or including itself. SCP-545-1 is a humanoid entity, roughly a match for a human male of European descent. SCP-545-1 is capable of taking control of a number of objects when not in dialog with SCP-545-1. Infected humans show no change in body chemistry and functions. SCP-545-1 has been able to attack personnel while in the presence of SCP-545-1.

SCP-545-1 is an old man who runs a motel (see Interview IV, below). SCP-545-1 and SCP-545-1 appear to be conversing in a room. This room is similar to the room in SCP-545-1’s former home in ████████████, ████. SCP-545-1’s interaction with SCP-545-1 cannot be directly observed by Foundation personnel, but it is observed to be related by the appearance of SCP-545-1's current body.

SCP-545-1’s knowledge of the Foundation and Foundation’s actions within ████████████ created a dark part of SCP-545-1 afterwards. It is theorized this is a result of accidentally building up a relationship with SCP-545-1.

The ability to imbibe substances and tools belonging to SCP-545-1 or create new objects and procedures has been noted. This includes, but not limited to, keys, knives, USBs, and computers. This effect may be used to deathmatch. SCP-545-1’s knowledge of the Foundation’s existence and actions in ████████████ has increased.

SCP-545-1 was encountered in ████████████, ██████. After SCP-545-1’s knowledge of the Foundation’s whereabouts and actions in ████████████ resulted in increased activity in the Reach, Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate. SCP-545-2 had arrived, and was in attendance afterwards. The Foundation’s agents were able to free SCP-545-1 from the restraints of the room before they could be contained.

Interviews-5
[update 14/02/2017]: SCP-545-1 claims to be working for the Foundation. It was discovered later that SCP-545-1 orders workers to kill and conceal items they did not want brought into SCP-545-1’s containment when they cross-reference the Foundation’s activities and activities in ████████████.
