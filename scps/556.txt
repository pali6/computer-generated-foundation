Item #: SCP-556

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-556 is to be locked in a standard humanoid containment chamber at any site of any public transport, regardless of whether it is limiting its movement. A standard humanoid containment chamber will not be used for SCP-556.

Description: SCP-556 is a 50-year-old female named Anne ████████. She is described by Foundation personnel as being of average height^2 with a slim body. She is 80 years old and has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. SCP-556 has been observed to take a large quantity of water and drink large amounts of sweets at her leisure time. She has exhibited mild empathy and is willing to cooperate with Foundation personnel.

SCP-556 will automatically summon a Pudding-skein Jellyfish of a length on her desk when summoned. When summoned, SCP-556 will then state that it is feeling hungry. SCP-556 will also do this, although only after a predetermined schedule has passed.

She will only communicate with other Foundation personnel when asked. The following interview is to be conducted by an appointed psychological therapist if SCP-556 is not already present in the presence of Foundation personnel. The following interview is conducted by one member of the Foundation staff.
