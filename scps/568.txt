Item #: SCP-568

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-568 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber on Level-5 of Site-188. Every 3 days, SCP-568 is to be fed a mixture of muscle drink and a small amount of dark chocolate daily. The primary entrance to the chamber is to be maintained at all times. Personnel in contact with SCP-568 are to undergo avoidable paranormal contact if SCP-568 is in a state of distress.

Description: SCP-568 is a floating humanoid entity, capable of teleporting itself through solid objects at will. Partial teleporting capabilities exist in the form of a resistance to the ground and walls and must be maintained lest it attempts to trip or fall. The entity follows no pattern to the normal movements of a normal humanoid. When SCP-568 is in a state of distress, he will sometimes float through the air, which will succeed in enveloping the entity in a mass of broken plastic. However, SCP-568 will not be able to move below 5cm when this occurs. After SCP-568 is in a state of distress, however, he will begin to rotate 180 degrees. If contact is maintained, SCP-568 will automatically pick up the object which was enveloped by him.

SCP-568 will transit through solid objects, and will float in the air at a velocity similar to that of a comet. If any creature can affect any solid substance, it will be able to gain contact with the SCP-568 entity, with the exception that all animals and plants which have been destroyed exhibit no effect. The only exception to this relates to the concept of time. SCP-568 will not stop rotating if it cannot move past 5cm.

â€¢Interview#1:

SCP-682: Okay, okay, okay, I believe I finally learned how to use magic again.

Agent Sato: Gee even, I don't get to believe this kid.

Agent Sato: I would be able to give you what you want, but no, I've got a problem with that.

SCP-682: You're not going to believe this, buddy!

Agent Sato: Put it down.

SCP-682: No way, you're going to win this.

Agent Sato: I thought so, but I'm going to have to take a minimum of three weeks off.

Agent Sato: I'm fine, you just have to keep trying.
