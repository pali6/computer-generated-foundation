Item #: SCP-592

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-592 cannot be contained, and should be kept in an airtight container. It should be kept at all times in a form that no more than twenty centimeters of its surface can be raised above the top of its container. Dust can be allowed to dry between the sealing cloth.

SCP-592 is to be kept sealed with a mild pressure-resistant closure by at least one member of staff.

Description: SCP-592 is a wooden toy electric pencil. It is made from an alloy of carbon, copper, nickel and other components that all have a similar composition, and are each shaped like a light yellow pencil. It is approximately one inch long and 10 centimeters wide by 10 centimeters thick.

When a human makes a written description, the pencil, similar to a ballpoint pen, will spontaneously appear within the subject's grasp, and the writing form of the description will appear to the subject in a form approximately 20 centimeters^3 from them. The description and writing form of the description and writing form will appear below the pencil thus evaluated.

It is clear that writing on any sample of SCP-592's surface forms writing of human speech. In addition, a repeatable weight can be easily produced by the application of SCP-592. Investigating the mechanism of this property is being undertaken.

SCP-592 could have been used as a toy to teach the reader how to use the toy but is not being used in order to that effect.
