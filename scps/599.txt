Item #: SCP-599

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-599 is currently contained at Site-212.

Description: SCP-599 is an anomalous item which affects all life within a radius of 5 metres or less.

SCP-599 is able to inactivate any organic material in the area, killing any organic life.

Approximately an hour after SCP-599 is activated, SCP-599 emits a pink-orange liquid that can be called "tactical neurocase", which, when heated, causes the subject to feel simultaneously as if they are being killed by all manner of suspicious entities and/or objects.

Note: A task force technician contacted by the task force has become aware of this fact, and has set up an unfazed mission to terminate SCP-599 and destroy the area.

Addendum: The blue blue pill contains a substance which is softer than SCP-599's material. The yellow blue pill contains a substance significantly denser than SCP-599's material.
