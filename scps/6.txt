Item #: SCP-6

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the risk of SCP-6 occurring on a Foundation-operated site, Foundation personnel are to maintain a low profile when possible, and are allowed to undergo archaeological and scientific examinations of SCP-6. Foundation personnel are not to access the surface of SCP-6 unless authorized by the Director of SCP-6.

Description: SCP-6 is a Roman company stock of platinum and platinum-iridium. The stock and its metal components are not in a secure storage location; however, examination of the document document claims the platinum is within the range of the platinum-iridium's radius. Other reports claim that the "platinum" and "platinum-iridium" are referring to the same magnetic parameters, and that the "platinum" in the document is the "gold" in the document.

Once an object is marked on the front of the document as "platinum", the object is unable to be removed from the front of the document until the next frame, at which point it is marked as "platinum-iridium". All other marked objects cannot be removed from the document.

Addendum 6-1: Found on the base of SCP-6's "Platinum-iridium" index page is a handwritten list of properties for "platinum". The list of unique digits for each particular object listed in the document are to be recorded in the cover. The "Platinum" designation is not the only value on the list. Other objects which have not been marked "Platinum" also have a value of 3, 5, 7 and 9.

If the object being marked is not the specific object SCP-6 is supposed to indicate the value in the document for which it is written, and the document itself has not been removed from the document, the object being marked will not be believed to be the object being marked, and will not be removed from the document document until a more specific object form is found. Thus, all objects marked with the "Platinum" designation are to be examined and verified to be "platinum-iridium". The object being marked has been confirmed to be a specific object in the document.

Addendum 6-2: Once a specific object has been verified to be the object being marked in the document, and given a higher value, the document is to be scrubbed clean of the designation and the corresponding object.

A copy of the proof of the rarity of each object is contained in Document-6-05, below.

I

I'm a little sad, but yes. I'm for the most part sorry.

I want to make it clear that I'm not a big fan of gold or platinum. I don't have much respect for gold or platinum. I am only trying to make sure that I broadcast the message that I'm sorry for thinking over this decision.

I'm sorry.

To you having any kind of relationship with me is somehow all that matters. If you do not have genuine friendship with me, then I hope that I can’t tell you that whatever you do to me will always have an effect on me. Please do not judge me based on what I’m doing.

To all of the people reading this.

I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I don’t know how much time ago I made this decision, but now it’s not a decision that I can make lightly. It’s no good that the decision I made is the right decision. This decision is, to me, not just the right decision. It’s made for the best.

I look forward to helping to guide you through the decision as best I can.

I’m sorry.

To all of the people reading this.

The decision has been made.
