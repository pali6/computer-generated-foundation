Item #: SCP-600

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: The complex contains a single main entrance (This entrance leads directly into the complex). The main location is designated as Level 5 Site-██. Access onto Level 5 is blocked to rank one level. Arm-on-side pre-unification ritual has been performed: Mobile Task Force Epsilon-7 is dispatched to all levels and to all entrances leading to Site-██.

On withdrawal, any arriving or departing personnel are to immediately remove arm-on-side access onto Level 5. Any personnel entering the complex are to be terminated and their body parts disposed of and incinerated.

Description: SCP-600 is a large brass altar composed of a skeletal structure, a column-mounted altar, a large, appended door, a raised platform and four embers and incense burners.

The Integral Structure - SCP-600 has been constructed out of 15 different materials, with a total weight of 50,000kg. Each of these objects has needed to be absorbed in its entirety by the foundation's superior materials engineering department.

The Integral Structure was originally built by a man named La Taché, in the early 16th century. The skull of both the Integral Structure and the altar were non-anomalous and are entirely made of effigies of Christ, in the shape of a cross and a Union Flag.

An inscription is etched into the door frame and caissures within the church. It reads:

Titanic must never be taken away

As long as they remain in the core, God will sustain them.

At the time of its construction, the Integral Structure still contained a number of small alter­ments. These alter­ments have been identified as SCP-600, which has caused considerable disturbances.

The Large Chapel - An immense room of some 5,500 square meters is built up from the ground floor of the Integral Structure and features several carved images of Christ. Inside the Chapel is an altar that appears to be stained with the body of the Lord, eyes of death, and a set of four curators.

At the time of the time of construction, three of the curators were wearing the crests of the Union Flag. These masks were peeled off, revealing minor facial features of the Union Flag. The Union Flag appears to have been stolen from the Site-██ant by the attackers of the church, and it is believed that the Union Flag has been stolen as well.

The cremation chamber for the Union Flag is constructed out of five porcelain vessels with inscriptions reading:

UNION FLAG: FOR THE LAST TIME CYRRH O GOD
