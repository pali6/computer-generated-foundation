Item #: SCP-601

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The town of [REDACTED] is to be taken over by the Foundation and administered access to its amenities. No intrusion into the town is to be allowed, unless done under strict experimental conditions.

Notes: All attempts to enter SCP-601's main square were denied. It is also impossible to enter SCP-601 without permission from at least one (1) Level 4 personnel.

Description: SCP-601 is [REDACTED] a small town located in the [REDACTED] mountain range. SCP-601's official size is 0.1km in perimeter, with a 0.5km wide gap outside the town itself. SCP-601 was inhabited by an estimated ██ persons, as it was inhabited by multiple members of the [[REDACTED].

SCP-601 was formally established in ████, a landlocked city which was subjected to rapid expansion in the late 19th century. SCP-601 was located in █████████, a small town of ██████, ██, ██. As the town started to grow in population, the property of the town was purchased by a wealthy farmer named █████████. He slowly expanded the city until it reached a capacity of 200km2.

As of ████, █████████ had the following property:

•Channel land surrounding SCP-601 is missing
•Channel land surrounding the town's main square is impossible to access.
•Channel land surrounding SCP-601 is permanently undefined and can not be used for anything.
•Channel land around SCP-601 and the other town squares cannot be explored.
•Channel land surrounding SCP-601 and the surrounding town squares cannot be explored.
•Channel land surrounding SCP-601 cannot be explored.

Due to the bandwidth of SCP-601 and the lack of communication from █████████, it is unlikely that the town or city is able to access SCP-601 or a face-on key within the town.

The property of SCP-601 was sold in a joint venture with █████████ in 6███, a city of ███████, ██. The property bought by █████████ was designated SCP-601-A.
