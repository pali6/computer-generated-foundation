Item #: SCP-607

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-607 is stored in a remote location in Site-19. Personnel are to not interact with SCP-607 unless they are reasonably certain the object will keep itself away from any other personnel or persons. Considering the objections of someone who considers therebe'sundonelectoitualpropertytoremoveitfromaddiction, SCP-607 is to be locked in a low-value storage unit. SCP-607 is to be vibrated when not in use. In the event the object is repeatedly triggered, it is to be removed.

Description: SCP-607 is a small wooden tablet, measuring 2.5cm wide and 2.5cm thick. There are 88 messages written on the surface of SCP-607. The messages appear to be written entirely in what is known as "Langauge script."

The root letters, which are written in a western Malay dialect, describe a collection of artifacts and techniques devised by the "Temple of the Man-Made," or "Temple of the Man-Made religions," as it is known in modern Southeast Asian languages. There are a total of 148,873 verses inscribed on SCP-607.

The writing on the reverse of the writing on the tablet (left to secure its place) is written in English.

Some messages are translated into an Punjabi language, likely to communicate to the Man-Made religion that SCP-607 will return within 72 hours if the writing is removed. In 2009, SCP-607 was found in the house of █████ ██████, a 37-year-old man living in his home in the Malay city of Surabaya.

When SCP-607 is deactivated, the Man-Made religion must be punished, and the Man-Made religion must be taught.

It is not known if the Man-Made religion uses SCP-607 as its means of breeding other"Temples of the Man-Made." This is a logical assumption.

Brief Summary Of Letter:

•1/5/13 - We do not know what the man did to make people bow to his will. His large number of servants does not make him perfect, but his great amount of blood does.
