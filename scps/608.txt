Item #: SCP-608

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Site-19 is to be severely restricted to the dog of the species, SCP-608 is to be contained within a five (5) meter by five (5) meter by five (5) meter cell. The containment chamber is to be constantly monitored by a containment specialist to ensure that SCP-608's condition does not worsen. The staff member responsible for the maintenance of the former containment chamber is to be promoted to the rank of the Senior Researcher Staff.

Description: SCP-608 is a white/violet retriever mix of indeterminate age, two (2) standard years, and the appearance of SCP-608's collar, pants, and shoes. SCP-608 has been documented with the loss of a close family member of the species, and is thought to be the offspring of three (3) potential parents - whose identity is still unknown.

Once a full twenty-four (24) (missing) years from the appearance of SCP-608's collar, SCP-608 displays apparent awareness of the existence of the dogs in its care, and shows this awareness in any dogs within an area where SCP-608 is available or physically interacted with. All dogs within this size range (listed in Addendum 602) have appeared in the containment chamber of Site-19. SCP-608 will remain in SCP-608's containment for the duration of an hour; when this occurs, ███ dogs within this area are to be immediately activated, and then terminated. SCP-608 will then reappear in Site-19.

When outside of SCP-608's containment area, SCP-608's behavior will be described by its containment specialist as "quiet" and "negative." Furthermore, SCP-608 remains in SCP-608's containment for five (5) minutes regardless of observed state of life of the dog, and will begin to mount any dogs in its line of sight immediately after initiating interaction. SCP-608 will not move or comment on the emotions or body language on the dogs present within its containment when in this state, or will attempt to use any other form of communication to communicate if it is unable to do so by any means.

When not in containment by dogs, SCP-608 will express a preference to pick at low moles (occasionally dogs that are affected by SCP-608's effects) rather than pick at other males (see Addendum 602).

Addendum 602: The content of Encounters with SCP-608 has been reported to be "profoundly pleasant". Observing a shift in SCP-608's personality after only four (4) days of its appearance without a adult dog within its containment area, staff member ICR-23 "Paddy" is advised to perform a discreet psychological check with researcher Dr. S████.

Addendum 603: SCP-608 has been observed to respond to other dogs within its territorial range.

Footnotes
1. It is hypothesized that it is the only other predator in a unitary area, and is not contiguous with all carnivores.
2. Due to SCP-608's anomalous behavior, it
does not display any form of hierarchy, and will not attack the weakest members of its species, disposing itself of any other direct physical threat (such as a biting tiger).
3. Extended containment protocols have been requested and approved by Project Head Dr. █████████.
4. SCP-608 shown to have a low level of aggression.
5. See Addendum 604.
6. EE-694-Case 204-Omega was reported to undergo mating for the third time upon arrival in Site-19's containment, and the egg hatched successfully during the three month period.
