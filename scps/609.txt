Subject: SCP-609-2

Due to its inability to be produced by any means, SCP-609-2 was originally assumed to have no anomalous properties. This assumption, however, is disputed by a significant number of researchers around the world.

To find a way to address the issue, a new classification has been devised. SCP-609-2 has been marked as SCP-609-3, as the ultimate purpose of SCP-609-2 is unknown.
