Item #: SCP-612

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-612 is to be kept in a refrigerated locker at the lowest temperature possible.

Description: SCP-612 is a Smith Miller 50-pack-sized tin can, brand signature unknown. The can has no apparent anomalous properties, and is produced by the company Smith Miller, Inc. It is not measured in chemical composition, and does not share any chemical properties with any known known Smith Miller trademark.

SCP-612 appears to be constructed of hard metal; samples collected show that it is the same alloy used in the manufacture of several common Smith or Miller products. All metals are completely usable without any major breakdown or oxidation in the sample.

SCP-612 was recovered from a ██████, ██ county landfill near ██████, Florida, in 2005. Police received reports of a 'ship in the sky' and a ship in the sky. After investigation, it was determined that the object was manufactured during World War II. SCP-612 was labeled as lost in the war, and was flown to the United States military's █████████ Shipyard, later here attached to the site of Site ██. Site ██ was designated as an "Incident Room".

The origin of the object is unknown.

SCP-612 has a mica-encrusted dial, on the underside of the slug-shaped bottle.

Multiple samples have been collected, all describing the same chemical formula.

Addendum:

SCP-612 was recovered on ██/██/████ after several properties would manifest themselves, including a metallic component drawn into the object. These effects were currently well-understood. The object shows distinctly different properties even when closer to Earth than Earth, and siphons off nutrients and water to trigger a new synthesis process. Testing results are unknown.

Note: More testing on SCP-612 and the effects of 1619. -Dr L█████
