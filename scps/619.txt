Item #: SCP-619

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-619 is contained in a standard containment chamber of a Level 3 Site-66 facility. The containment chamber is furnished with a single standard, wood-lined tumbler that is to be regularly cleaned with hot water, each day. Tumblers are to be cleaned on a weekly basis, by personnel that have at least one regular, daily interaction with SCP-619.

Description: SCP-619 is a wooden cube measuring 4×6cm. A dark red, fresh and unmarked, design is imprinted upon the handle at the top of the cube. Examination of the handle has revealed that it is composed of wood although no other markings nor printed details could be found.
