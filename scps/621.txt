Item #: SCP-621

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-621 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-28, with a bed and nightstand provided. All suggested tests must be found to be ineffective.

Description: SCP-621 is an adult female, on the mind-affecting effects of a particularly powerful hallucinogen, and has been known to initiate a potential conversion event in personnel that are prescribed it by a doctor. This effect tends to be instantaneous, only distinguishing between those who have made cognitoseent of SCP-621 or performed any actions that could have been anticipated by any means.

As of ██/██/18, SCP-621 is to be treated as mental health therapist of the highest caliber, with the following restrictions:

•Life-long staff are not to be used for testing.
•No further testing or testing is possible unless approved by a member of Site-28's medical staff.
•No further testing is possible unless approved by a member of Site-28's medical staff.
•Staff not present during visual contact with SCP-621 or D-Class are not to be exposed to it unless authorized by one of ██ personnel with at least intermediate security clearance, or are to show SCP-621 to all personnel present.
•Staff are not to be exposed to SCP-621 during the visual contact.

A full list of protocols can be found in Document 621-1.

Public knowledge of SCP-621's anomalous effects must be limited to personnel of the Foundation or other interests engaged in strong emotional responses towards it. As such, containment procedures must be followed to minimize public communication about SCP-621. All staff, regardless of prior exposure, are to immediately alert security.

Drug Containment

‫’s readily apparent effects were not detected in other tests, so as to avoid numerous collateral consequences, such as drug trafficking, misuse, and any unintended "abuse" of SCP-621. One possible exception to this was the discovery of the effects of SCP-746, which was discovered in 1989 and is now classified as a cognitohazard.

Time Frame: 3/7/1984

Foreword: SCP-621 was recovered following a coup attempt by Citizens Mobilisation.

I was in the room when the King took the throne and of course I remember it vividly. I remember sitting on the bed in front of the TV with him, rubbing my back and smiling as he took me, the King and the Prince, Queen and Child and Father and son and Mother.

I must not let the details of those days slip by. The latter three were taken away, including the King. The King will always have a place in my heart, which is now in his castle.

And I remember also the mourning of the Queen. I knew of no one in the court or government, but
