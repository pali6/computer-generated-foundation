Item #: SCP-626

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-626 is to be stored in a secure joint containment facility at Site-66. Testing of SCP-626 is to be carried out without direct human interface without the use of a lethal force. The testing of SCP-626 is to be carried out by an authorized personnel during the testing intervals. In the event that during testing SCP-626 is not responded to, the arm so fired will immediately return to normal and receive an E-ticket and SCP.

Description: SCP-626 appears to be a standard green spray paintball.^1 However, when fired, SCP-626 will be able to spray a thin layer of paint from its nozzle onto any surface in close proximity, without emitting a sound.

After spraying the paint, the spray paint will instantly evaporate, forming a sphere of paint that cannot be recontained. SCP-626 is capable of spraying an infinite amount of paint in a single shot, taken from either the nozzle or the nozzle in the arm, and as a result is able to cover surfaces in a radius of 10 meters.

SCP-626 was successfully used in a testing event on ██/██/20██.
