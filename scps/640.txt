Item #: SCP-640

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-640-1 is to be kept on a standard safe-class humanoid containment room at the site of SCP-640-1's discovery. Due to SCP-640-1's relative safety, D-Class personnel are to be kept away from SCP-640-1.

Description: SCP-640-1 is a female humanoid approximately 4 meters tall, with a long, thin body. SCP-640-1 is dressed only in human-skin clothing.

SCP-640-1 was recovered from a house in ██████ ██, France, 19██. The house is owned by the "Skauls" business association, and the owners of the property appeared to be aware of SCP-640-1's appearance, and expressed interest in possessing it for "research purposes."

Addendum: Containment of SCP-640-1 is no longer a priority, and use of reverse-memes to contain SCP-640-1 is restricted.

Description: SCP-640-1 appears very much like a normal bone carvings habitation model. SCP-640-1 is full of quite large, carved, jade-like patterns. One can process the patterns into a simple clear sheet in minutes.

SCP-640-1 is capable of surviving in any weather conditions, and will grow old and weak if not nourished for extended periods of time. One thing SCP-640-1 cares for is to not burn out, and if exposed to a persistent fire, it will attack the person in the skin.

Addendum: D-Class personnel are to be kept apart from SCP-640-1, and should not be reminded of the subject's name.

SCP-640-1 was found dealing in the care of SCP-640-1's petite surroundings, and essentially disappeared in 1990.
