Item #: SCP-645

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-645 is to be contained in an anomalous properties containment chamber at Site 3. The chamber is to be examined daily by at least two D-class personnel. The result of any experimental process, including flooding of the chamber or starvation of any elements therein should not result in SCP-645's release. In the event of an SCP-645-S occurring, all personnel will immediately give up anything they have been holding and/or are capable of holding and attempt to throw it back. This is usually enough to result in the release of SCP-645.

Description: SCP-645 is a box of a blue, white, and green color. The label of the package reads "To Protect From Disaster", and the description of SCP-645 is redacted.

When an individual holds SCP-645 for more than five minutes, immediately after the individual's perception of SCP-645's contents are altered, they enter a lucid state. No other physical effects manifest.

After a period of three minutes, the individual enters a lucid state, and the box of SCP-645 is opened. It will then expunge itself.

Addendum: Four days after the box containing SCP-645 was opened, the box was found filled with a brown, white, green, and red color, respectively. Six weeks later, the box opened once more.

SCP-645 was contained on 20/05/1971, in a blane. The object is currently on Site ██, and is to be kept in a display box with a lock, for reasons of courses.

Addendum 645-1: Investigation of the item is to be conducted through research personnel (Researcher ████ was killed in action).

Addendum 645-2:

Foreword: The item SCP-645 was recovered during the purchase of a ████ restaurant in █████████, ██ on 19/05/1973, which stated that several of its boxes had come to life following a simultaneous event, and were either dropped into a vat, burned, or melted into a living skeleton.

SCP-645 was later found in a vat in ██████████ by the Foundation, and was under constant surveillance for the next three days. Testing on the item was suspended until D-class personnel were able to complete the actual process. The device was recovered on ██/██/1973, and containment was established on ██/██/1973.

Researcher ████ was killed in action during the ensuing assault on the facility by an instance of SCP-645-1.

It is unknown if the box possess any anomalous properties.

4. Witnesses describe hearing a door slide shut, and a layer of metal overlaps a layer of other metals, which is suggested to be the mechanism by which SCP-645 is sealed.
