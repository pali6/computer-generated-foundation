Item #: SCP-657

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-657 has been contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-17. SCP-657 must remain where only it is visible to at least one staff member at all times. All attempts to remove or damage SCP-657 can be stopped by its own effect.

Description: SCP-657 appears to be a humanoid entity approximately 1 meter in height, with elongated arms, legs, and face. SCP-657 is mostly covered in a white, oily substance, and most of the teeth are hollow. SCP-657 is entirely animate, and is capable of vocalizing in English. SCP-657 has displayed the ability to exercise its anomalous properties to remove items from the environment around it. The only way to stop or damage SCP-657 is to remove the item in question. SCP-657 does not cause damage or harm itself, even when unable to withstand physical pain or damage.

The effectiveness of the effect SCP-657 used to remove items from a living creature is directly proportional to the volume of the object removed. The exact mechanism by which items are removed is unknown.

The only known method to stop SCP-657 is to run back in time. The current attempt to run back in time with the use of a small telescope failed, leaving SCP-657 in a completely different location and time, and removing something that it had not previously removed.

Addendum: SCP-657 was recovered in ██████████, ████.
