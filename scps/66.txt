Item #: SCP-66

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-66 is contained in a standard human sized storage box. SCP-66-1 is contained within a six-metre storage box. SCP-66-1 is to be fed a diet of raw chicken once a day to replace lost caloric intake.

Description: SCP-66 is a male human who requires food sustenance. SCP-66 sports a number of nonanomalous organs, and is capable of speech. SCP-66 is capable of rendering any programming with an Arduino microcontroller within five (5) hours of being fed.

SCP-66 is located in a warehouse in ██████ ██████, ██████, ██████████, and responds to external stimuli.

Automatic testing of SCP-66 has proven inconclusive, but has not revealed any unusual characteristics. A full list of these warning signs is available to preauthorized research personnel. SCP-66 states that it believes the entity to be "wooing" the entity, though it has not explained what it means.

When touched by a human, SCP-66 will discover a specific answer to its own initial "interview question". This is likely due to the entity's inherent form of communication. SCP-66 is also aware of the entity, and will attempt to communicate with it.

Following this the entity will produce a mercenary suit and an anomalous item from one of two possible sources. SCP-66's limited intelligence and in-built anomalous properties are likely to cause SCP-66 to "plead" in return. SCP-66 does not know what the previous product is or what it is saying, and has only been provided with items of varying purpose. ████████ ████████, who monitors SCP-66's anomalous properties throughout the upper echelons of the Foundation hierarchy, has been specified as SCP-66's primary driver.

At this point SCP-66's anomalous properties become apparent. The entity's introspection, or lack thereof, is likely to cause it to identify themselves. Proficiency in a practical knowledge of CAD, computer science, or basic engineering is required. Foundation personnel testing SCP-66 said some of the following:

•Their life is on the line.
•They have paid for this.
•Their of interest can be accessed only through limited means.
•The entity is ambitious in order.
•They are a threat to the Foundation's safety.
•They threaten the Foundation's containment.

Upon doing nothing for several hours SCP-66 will directly answer the question.

Addendum 6: SCP-66's creation process is currently unknown. In the event that SCP-66 is made aware of what's in its possession, it will assume that it can get away with using the items it requests to. If the entity is held, SCP-66 will assume the following:

•The entity has access to the Foundation's systems, information, and the means to defeat them.
•The entity has access to anomalous materials.
•The entity knows the Foundation's layout of the Foundation, and will know how to access them.
•The entity knows the Foundation's functions.

On ██/██/██, SCP-66 allegedly received a 'hoo' from the "wooing" entity. Upon inquiring what the entity's status was, SCP-66 received a response similar to the entity's within the space of a few minutes.

Since the commencement of containment procedures, SCP-66 has been allowed access to items produced by the SCP-2647 that is otherwise not contained; these items come with the purchase of a Foundation liaison and no containment procedures have been observed.

Addendum 7: SCP-66 appears to have a fairly good memory; in the event that SCP-66 is unable to remember something, it will subconsciously remember what it is unable to recall. This effect has been observed to persist even when SCP-66 has beaten the entity into submission.

Addendum 8: SCP-66 has told several Foundation personnel in recent weeks that SCP-666 has a construction date. This has been deemed likely due to SCP-66's lacking guidance in how to construct it; SCP-66 has been told of construction progress since its initial containment procedures.

Addendum 9: SCP-66 has told many Foundation personnel that SCP-666's propulsion is comprised of nature's waste.

Addendum 10: SCP-66 was found dead on 3/5/2017 in ████████ ████, ██████████, just in time to be one of the first personnel to reactivate SCP-2647.
