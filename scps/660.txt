Item #: SCP-660

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-660 is contained in a low-value musical instrument storage facility on Site-███, and is scheduled for routine testing after 5 days per month. The initial "hit" of SCP-660 must be broken with a small amount of force, and SCP-660 must be wound within 1.5 hours to prevent tissue damage.

Description: SCP-660 is a medium-sized musical instrument with a stylus crafted from malleable weave. The stylus is not fully formed, and it changes its shape twice per minute. The stylus is intended to be used to create musical notes, which SCP-660 scales by hand.

SCP-660 normally measures at approximately 85cm long and 40cm wide, but it can be expanded to a max of 95cm by hand.

Despite the sheer volume, SCP-660 has no mechanical parts. The material that makes up SCP-660's operational unit is ethereal. It is composed entirely of a set of unknown composition, and its composition does not differ from the rest of the sonic medium it contains. SCP-660 has the ability to produce notes shaped like a musical scale. Music produced by SCP-660 will function as musical notes. Using a musical note created by SCP-660 will produce a recording of the original score. The process of producing a musical note is identical to composition.

It is currently unknown how SCP-660 functions. Though the use of a musical note removes all effects of the tuning mechanism, the legal standard of the system is not yet known. The SCP-660 has been found to produce improvised notes similar to those created by SCP-660, which function similarly.

Informed consent is required for a process known as "playing a musical note back", in which SCP-660 will produce a recording of the original score, which is recorded for playback. See Addenda SCP-660-2.

Addendum SCP-660-1:

Previous containment procedures

SCP-660 should be kept on a flat surface in a standard soundproofed soundproofed soundproof-locker, and should be kept in an easy-to-access storage unit (3m x 3m x 1.5m). The anomalous qualities of the stylus have been removed by cleaning the base layer of the stylus off with a small amount of force, and winding the stylus within 2.5 hours to prevent tissue damage.

Previous containment procedures failed to remove SCP-660's other anomalous properties. In order to create a musical note, the stylus must be used to create the tones present in the improvised compositional piece.
