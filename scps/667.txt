Item #: SCP-667

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-667 is to be contained on the sixth floor of [REDACTED] for observation and research purposes. MTF Nu-07 ("Hunting") has been established to dispose of SCP-667-1, in order to prevent SCP-667-2 using it.

SCP-667-1 instances are to be released into the wild with SCP-667-2 in order to prevent the spread of SCP-667-2's anomalous properties (see Addendum 2.3.i).

Description: SCP-667 is a rusted metal table and a spoon-shaped apparatus, apparently dating from the late 19th century. SCP-667 is made of steel and filled with a thick red viscous fluid^1. The liquid near the top of the apparatus is consistent with all known forms of mummification metrics considered within the Foundation's knowledge.

When SCP-667-1 is moved to SCP-667, it becomes visible and appears as a living, living entity. SCP-667-1 normally remains inert, and does not move from SCP-667 for long periods of time. ████ instances of SCP-667-1 have been discovered, all of which were believed to be dead for unknown reasons.

SCP-667-2 will appear within SCP-667-1 within three minutes of movement. Communication with SCP-667-2 will be impossible, and will only cease in two minutes of movement. Death will also be instantaneously.

The only results resulting effect SCP-667-2 has is the unbroken continuity of the liquid inside the apparatus. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. It is believed that SCP-667-2 emerges from the surface of the black substance wielded by SCP-667-1, and drifts around SCP-667-2 until it enters SCP-667 or the universe^2.
