Item #: SCP-682

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: All instances of SCP-682 are to be contained in a sound proofed storage room within Site-19 on Level-3. All personnel investigating SCP-682 will report to their supervisor if they are conducting a thorough walk.

The following printouts have been compiled using a standardized font and color-shift routine, as well as Document 404-2F1A.

Description: SCP-682 is a simple yellow-green ink-jet printer. It was found within a debris field in [DATA EXPUNGED] in ██/████, ██/██.

SCP-682 dashes through [DATA EXPUNGED] upon reaching the printing surface. After seven more of these prints arrive, the printer starts emitting static/vibrant light via extracyan photonic laser, and, after approximately twenty-one shots, SCP-682 disappears.

When the current print is finished, the following effect can be activated: Printouts created by SCP-682 will appear on the blackboard of the containment room.

With the exception of [DATA EXPUNGED] and [REDACTED], persons that enter the print area are not subject to SCP-682's effects. However, they will instantly become 'able' to interact with SCP-682 upon reaching it.

Buttoning the controls of SCP-682 will cause the subject to be able to operate SCP-682 with impunity.

Following the printing of SCP-682, which appears to be one of the chief characteristics of SCP-682, an anomalous effect will invariably manifest. This effect cannot be triggered in all instances of SCP-682, and was not observed once. All instances of SCP-682 were manifested along with SCP-682's anomalous effects.

After 12 minutes of operation, as SCP-682 exits the print area, each individual that viewed SCP-682's print will have their stomach or intestines replaced with the printed image of SCP-682. In all cases, this effect was shown to completely incapacitate all individuals entering SCP-682's primary containment chamber, leading to the creation of Item #: SCP-682.

Description: SCP-682 is a basic yellow-green ink-jet printer with a black clear-coat on its surface. It was discovered in ██/██████, ██/██.

It appears to be made of paper. SCP-682 each print cycles through 664 iterations from the top, followed by 960 iterations from the bottom. The print volume of SCP-682 is consistent with that of a standard inkjet printer of ██/████.
