Item #: SCP-684

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-684 is to be contained in a large containment locker in Site-██'s eventual future. Guards are to approach the locker and, when in sight, instantaneously disarm it, preventing entry. No other personnel are to come into contact with SCP-684 until an explanation has been given, and they are to immediately be removed from the facility.

Description: SCP-684 is a silver key, with a small silver sac underneath the handle. When the sac is removed, SCP-684 unlocks the door, revealing a door sealed within a large laboratory. Inside, SCP-684 is empty. When approached, SCP-684 calls out for them to come in and gets the subject to approach it - the subject will become hostile and attempt to break through the seal. SCP-684 will then stop talking and wait for the subject to go in. Once the subject has been inside, SCP-684 will proceed to remove the golden key, and begin the second season of nurturing the subject's spirit until they are grown and ready for a suitable mate. Then, SCP-684 destroys their spirit (creating a trophy-head illusion), and prays for them to pursue their own true love.

Note: The only way to revive the subject is if the subject is willing to let you do it. If the subject is unwilling to let you do it, then you can leave them in the lab, and they can go back home again after a proper identification. -Dr. ███

Dr. ███████ himself was unaware of the effectiveness of the procedure.
