Item #: SCP-688

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: All instances of SCP-688-1 are to be kept in individual containment cell 13 in Site-██. Any personnel wishing to access SCP-688 must have approval from Level 4 personnel, and all testing must be cleared by Dr. K█████.

Description: SCP-688 is a pink handmade tumbler decorated with a picture of a small child, with a transparent black handle and a sliding handle. The handle is identical to SCP-688 except it is made of titanium and has an engraved '2' stenciled on the top edge.

The handle is roughly 1.2m long and 1.6m wide. It has been found to be beautifully crafted, with a twist made into the handle during the manufacture of the tumbler.

SCP-688 was recovered from █████████A, a family cemetery near ██████████, though the owner of the graveyard was never located, and rumors of his death were brought to the Foundation in ██████████. It was discovered that SCP-688 was made with the intention of creating a material breach into Earth and was intended to be used in the process.
