Item #: SCP-698

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-698 is contained at Site-31.

Description: SCP-698 is an approximately 4 ft x 4 ft x 4 ft concrete wall. It is composed of regular asphalt with a layer of tungsten-cured concrete. A door is bolted to SCP-698's wall at the point of entry. One bedroom unit of 5 x 5 x 5 meters constitutes the largest portion of SCP-698's structure. Three secondary bedrooms and living quarters form the second largest portion of the structure.

SCP-698's walls are constructed of ordinary orifices, commonly known as doors. The house is constructed of a block of high-quality concrete and is situated in a vertical position relative to the ground. The exterior walls of SCP-698 are made primarily of the grade-E coefficient polyurethane. They have large holes drilled in their floors, walls, and ceilings in order to facilitate light entry, and large openings in the ceilings and walls.

All living quarters in SCP-698 are equipped with rainwater collectors and plentiful rain water drainage systems. SCP-698's main residence hall is a featureless rectangular room constructed of a block of high-level grade aluminum. It’s constructed of the same grade of grade and composition as SCP-698’s exterior walls. It is situated at the centre of the structure, holding approximately 80 square meters of the main floor, and approximately 130 square meters of the additional two bedrooms, one bathtub, and one large living room.

SCP-698’s main administrative and storage areas are situated in the basement of its residence, a large, unencumbered building. The basement’s only visible feature for the time being is a single small door. It is three metres in length and faces a basement level, the only visible source of fresh water into SCP-698’s structure. SCP-698 has a large basement within standard operating parameters. The basement floor is approximately 10 metres above the bottom of the basement, and is lined with four separate carvings, most of which SCP-698 has yet to identify.

In light of prevailing geology^1, it is hypothesized that the house’s built controls the motion of the main residence, and does so in a systematic, pre-determined manner, with an intensity of effect not yet fully understood by SCP-698.

Further monitoring of the basement’s control is maintained by a small observatory in the second bedroom, with the primary observatory situated in the main bedroom’s living room.

The primary observatory is a small, circular cave located near the bottom of the house. A heavy chain is attached to the primary observatory, and is designed to link the observatory to the basement entrance.

Update: The basement floor of the basement of SCP-698 has been completely covered in plastic. At present, no other exits or entrances are able to be made.

Soundproofing of the secondary observatory is in progress.
