Item #: SCP-699

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-699 is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, designated as SCP-699-1. This containment cell is equipped with a standard-weight audio-visual recording device with a 2-hour battery. SCP-699-1 is to be fed three variables at the expected time intervals^1. The first variable is [DATA EXPUNGED]. During the second variable, SCP-699-1 can be released into the outside world. This can be done by taking the device out of SCP-699-1, shutting it down, then back in when the following two variables are in place:

1. At the time the variable is entered, SCP-699-1 activates. While the outer surface of SCP-699-1 does not produce sound, the innermost surface does. The frequency of the noise produced is high; as long as the outer silent membrane is inaudible, no sound is produced. The frequency and intensity of the sound produced during the second variable is consistent to other recorded recordings recorded during the same occurrence. [DATA EXPUNGED].
2. At the time the variable is entered, SCP-699-1 shuts down. SCP-699-1 does not appear to react to anything outside of SCP-699-1, nor does it appear to produce silence upon entering the next iteration of the third variable.

Addendum:

•At the time the first rate of the sound coming from SCP-699-1 triggered, no one was in the room, and no damage of any sort was done to the outer barrier.
•The sound can be heard through closed doors, windows, or other invisible barriers. No sound has been detected coming from the inner barrier.
•No sound has been detected coming from the outer barrier.

Under no circumstances should anyone to enter or leave SCP-699-1 be aware that the sound coming from SCP-699-1 has become audible.

Description: SCP-699-1 is a 7 meter tall humanoid containment chamber constructed of reinforced high-end glass. The containment chamber is placed in a space-time anomaly, designated SCP-699-2.

SCP-699-1 is designed to be a standard containment chamber for a 3th dimension construct with a variable width. SCP-699-1 is constructed of reinforced glass, and is connected to the inner barrier of SCP-699-2. Applicants wishing to use SCP-699-1 as a workstation or lab can either remove SCP-699-1 directly from SCP-699-1, and place it back into one of the adjacent walls, or alternatively, use SCP-699-1 as the containment unit of the workstation.

When an individual enters the containment chamber, they will be transported to a dimension in which SCP-699-1 exists, and will become the new employee of SCP-699-2. Personnel will be required to deactivate their comms, cameras, and other recording devices within SCP-699-2. If necessary, personnel are to continue documenting and recording the instant the staff enters SCP-699-2.

SCP-699-2 is functionally identical to SCP-699-1, and does not exist. If the current workers are seated at SCP-699-2, or are introduced to SCP-699-2 later, SCP-699-2 will vanish, and all workers will be apposed to SCP-699-1.

It is unknown how long SCP-699-2 exists.
