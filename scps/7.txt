Item #: SCP-7

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: The area surrounding SCP-7 is fenced off and guarded by Keter-level security personnel and electric fencing, and are not to come within 300m of SCP-7. Foundation-issue firearms are to be kept within the enclosure. Personnel entering SCP-7 are to exit only with the permission of the Site Director and, when necessary, with approval from the Site Director. Personnel escaping SCP-7 are not to be allowed access to the area outside the enclosure.

Any surveillance camera may be used to record any trespassers, as long as they are not brought within 300m outside of SCP-7. Any attempt to record violations of this security protocol are to be reported immediately.

Description: SCP-7 is a cave located in Costa Rica, typical of those found in the Sahara Desert. Its walls are of normal size, as larger caves tend to be, but it is opaque, and its floor is rungs are nearly 400m above ground level. SCP-7 is not of any special geological interest or natural formation, but rather, its walls and floor a perfect 60° angle for a human to access.

When any living being is affected by SCP-7, their skin is unable to move, and their nervous system is unable to build up sufficient strength. The only means that living beings are affected by the effect are scratches, bruises, and bites from living animals. All living beings affected can make words, sounds and sounds become unheeded, or at least altered. Animals that have been affected by this effect outside of SCP-7 will not have any memory of it, with test subjects doing so considering the impact to be a "death" to the organism. The affected subject has no recollection of their time outside of SCP-7. Once affected, SCP-7 remains well within SCP-7's wall until interrupted. The effects of SCP-7 cease on any living subject touched once they have been outside SCP-7 for less than 180 minutes, after which SCP-7 will begin to reveal its contents. If a living creature enters SCP-7, no other organisms will enter SCP-7.

Any living organism touched by SCP-7 will experience a sensation of overwhelming anxiety, any amnestics given, or a combination of both. This sensation is permanent, even after SCP-7 reveals itself, despite the subject's body having been in the presence of SCP-7's effect for between 15 and 20 minutes. The subject will not be able to build up a normal nervous system, even with repeated exposure. Those affected by the effect are incapable of seeing bodies, hearing, or smelling outside SCP-7. Those touched by SCP-7 may attempt to escape, but will often find themselves unable to move or communicate. Those exposed to SCP-7 have no recollection of the duration they spent in SCP-7, with those who do recall experiencing feeling nothing but anxiety for the duration being unable to explain their time in the presence of SCP-7.
