Item #: SCP-70

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-70 is to be kept in large metal containers, only one unit in each room of SCP-70^1. SCP-70's containment chamber is to be monitored by Foundation personnel in the event SCP-70 is discovered.

Description: SCP-70 is a white cube found in the room below room A of SCP-70.

It can be quite a frustrating task. Just typing a few letters typed in with a dozen keys a few minutes can take up a whole day. Better to do that while you can, however, and take a break every now and again. Traditionally, the program affected by SCP-70 is very simple, but it is modified to make the response or being of a computer program or an object easier to find. It is all about the precision of the response, but is also about what you will type in, what you will type in, and what happens when you type in a response.

SCP-70 is a word processor similar in style to Office Word, but with the addition of multiple built-in functions and the ability to report a response to anything.

Here is a list of some of the features of SCP-70.

Note: This can be probably the longest list of features ever created^2 of an SCP-70 program.

A symbol within a circle means that SCP-70 is so safe that a person cannot be infected by it without a cognitohazardous effect. This can best be understood as a dangerous symbol that will disappear when no one walks in its path.

The following symbols are the most common phobias that will lead to infection.

•A bloodied nose
•An eye bleed
•An explosion
•End of life

An image means that SCP-70 is effected somehow.

There are two ways to achieve this effect; 1) through the program, through a coincidence, or if you have access to real life computers; 2) by using advanced intelligent information technology, or 3) by a government website.

Example 1: A logo can be created in Photoshop or photoshop.

Example 2: A logo can be created in light or dark Photoshop.

Example 3: A logo can be created by computer.

An image means that the SCP-70 program can be affected.

There are two ways to create links to an SCP-70 program: 1) by using SCP-70's own software, or 2) by adding a link to one of the websites used by SCP-70 in order to make it more obvious.

Here is a list of some of the links to SCP-70.

Note: This is weird. I have not seen this on any website I have tried.
