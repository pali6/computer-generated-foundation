Description: SCP-703 is a 30-year-old woman residing in ████████, South Carolina, USA. SCP-703 developed a pattern of behaviors to induce self-destructive behavior (see Addendum 3703-1).

Three days after SCP-703's discovery, the principal inhabitants of the town began attempting to destroy evidence of SCP-703's presence. This behavior was index at first, and in the course of three months, hit the 'First-Time' mark. The town council, the local police department and the media were all overthrown.

On 7/6/1966, SCP-703 was named a State of Sorrow article and it proceeded to rapidly expand in size. Its growth slowed down to zero in 1977, though non-anomalous members of the townspeople attempted to capture SCP-703 and continually attempted to destroy the location. During an attack on the mysterious group-of-people, a video tape showed SCP-703 having a closed-door agreement with them that was extended to extended private security. Eventually the tape literally went to the news and regardless of the apparent crime, the townspeople were killed.

As a result, the townspeople were given counseling to learn how to survive the next three decades.
