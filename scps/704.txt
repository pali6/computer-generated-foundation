Item #: SCP-704

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-704 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-04. Recording equipment at Secure Containment Area-03 has been disabled by force of order, in order to prevent transmission of images from within. Outside of this procedure, SCP-704 is to be allowed access to testing chambers.

Description: SCP-704 is a humanoid entity of indeterminate shape that possesses no discernible physical characteristics. SCP-704 is a medium-sized insectoid entity (hereon referred to as SCP-704-1) that possesses a single, oval horned face. Securing this face with tissue-like material is a breach of order; SCP-704-1 is capable of manipulating and moving SCP-704, and is capable of cutting itself through fully-grown humanoid structures in order to discharge a over-the-counter substance approximately three meters long.

SCP-704 is sentient, and will only speak when spoken with. This includes making statements such as "When I talk to you, you will listen to me", "When I talk to you, you will listen to me", and "When I talk to you, you will listen to me". These statements have no effect when SCP-704 is put in a real vacuum, as it will only make static noises and vocalizations if said creaking or moving object is placed in a vacuum. SCP-704 can also communicate using a singular, standardized "unibornable" voice, rather than using a variety of other speech responses in order to elicit responses. SCP-704 attempts to paint any non-human being who calls it by its designated name "something" with its horned face, and attempts to frame the person who uses it as its mouth to do so.

If either of SCP-704 speech responses are spoken by a human being, the effect of its anomalous abilities will activate. SCP-704 will then attempt to use whatever utterance form it is able to produce, taking it as its own word as if it was speaking first. The effectiveness of SCP-704's speech capabilities may be random, but will always trigger when spoken by a human being.

In order to produce the most rapid effects, SCP-704 is capable of creating new "memes" that are created through vocalizations made to it by another person. These reactions have the ability to cut through solid matter to divert the flow of air and water into SCP-704, which can provide a positive or negative result depending on the situation.

SCP-704-1 possesses the ability to communicate with other "memes" produced with SCP-704. If SCP-704-1 exists within the vicinity of the base of its "conspirator", SCP-704-1's first response to a human being will be "no", and the following phrases will begin to manifest on the surface of SCP-704.

• "I did not hear your comingsrd", "You were not a problem to me", "So what were you?", "You were just sick of me".
• "I did not want to hear you speak", "Do you wish you could tell me what a rude and irritable person was to you?", "You were not a problem for me.", "I do not wish to hear you speak again", "I can not ask you to tell me what a rude and irritable person is to you, but I will not stop in order to hear you speak.", "I am a middling bureaucrat.", "You should have told me what a lowly and irritable person would do."
• "I am a middling bureaucrat", "Pardon me for interrupting.", "Good as new.", "I am not happy about this situation", "You should have told me what a lowly and irritable person would do"
• "I am a middling bureaucrat", "You should have told me who I should know", "You should have told me what a lowly and irritable person would do", "You should have told me what a lowly and irritable person would concern me", "I do not hope to have much of a talk with you.", "I do not know how you feel about the situation", "I have nothing to add to it.", "I hope the Foundation will consider me to be a treatable individual.", "I hope I will not lose my job".
• "I did not hear your comingsrd", "You were not a problem to me"
• "I could not think of anything to say to you", "You were a thing to me.", "I would rather you not know what I did to have to do with you than to ask me what it was like for you".
• "I wished to follow you to see the Heavens", "I am not a supplicant to you, I have only been following you to see the Heavens
