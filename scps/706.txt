Item #: SCP-706

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-706 is to be contained in a standard non-conventional facility. The equipment necessary for maintenance is to be checked daily.

Description: SCP-706 is a 33.5kg 9" x 12" flat (50 centimetres) box, measuring 100cm x 30cm x 30cm.

SCP-706 was designed and manufactured by Michael Spindel in 1978, in collaboration with John Strand, Lujani, and other original members of Spindel-J.

SCP-706 is extremely hot to the touch, and has been noted for its ability to rapidly heat itself up to around 10,000C, producing an average of 5,000C worth of heat to any surface or object within an area of impact.

The obstructing material of SCP-706 currently does not exhibit any kinetic properties, despite its extremely strong, accelerating shock barrier.

The cause of SCP-706's initial release is unknown, although there is some evidence that the event must have been caused by a hitherto unknown, non-localised anomalous object (more specifically the object of interest is the object).

SCP-706 could not have been considered a nuclear weapon or a weapon of mass destruction, solely because of its high cost of manufacture.
