Item #: SCP-711

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-711 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-114.

Description: SCP-711 is a 40 year old Caucasian male (hereafter referred to as SCP-711-1), formerly a member of the Russian Federal Security Service Oikonomat. SCP-711-1 has a hard, life-long scar covering the left side of his chest, which was bitten into on occasion by SCP-711.

SCP-711 is capable of communicating using a large, black device on the left side of SCP-711's chest. SCP-711-1 described this device to the subject as “a small black box, with a button, a dial and a small blue light”. SCP-711-1 was in possession of the device for 2 years before a change of circumstances. Upon coming into contact with SCP-711, SCP-711-1 senses from him a painful feeling of being made to suffer. The extraterrestrial entity then begins to make physical contact with the subject, leaving him unable to move. SCP-711 was unable to negotiate until he appeared to find a way of terminating SCP-711 when it became conscious of its power over him. As he was in a state of anastasakosis at the time, SCP-711 was able to scream loudly away from SCP-711 before succumbing to
[DATA EXPUNGED].

The subject's body was removed for a relative week after this event, after which he made an attempt on his own life, but ended up dazed, unable to move, and died suddenly.

Though not physically native to SCP-711, SCP-711-2 was able to survive the attack with minimal injuries, but was apparently extremely distressed by the incident. SCP-711-2 was eventually returned to the planet SCP-711 was retrieved from, and became a member of the Russian Federal Security Service Oikonomat once SCP-711-3 had disappeared from their command post.

Removal of SCP-711-3 should be attended to as soon as possible.

Description: SCP-711-1 was 32 years old at the time of the incident. SCP-711-3 was an adult female (hereafter referred to as SCP-711-2), who died during an incident with SCP-711 that contacted Foundation personnel.

SCP-711-3 possesses a transmuted tokamak, capable of infecting the mind of anyone in contact, as well as multiplying through the use of psionic arms. SCP-711-3 is perfectly capable of making any form of persuasive speech, and it is believed that it may be sentient.

Should SCP-711-3 appear to the subject, it will start to make them suffer. The superintelligent entity will begin by making them feel their body hurt. The entity has claimed that this is its 'only way” to get what it wants. The entity will then use these sensations to attempt to fill the subject’s thoughts, instead of just telling them what to do. SCP-711's claims have been, in reality, full of inconsistencies, and contradictory predictions. The entity grows quite quickly, and has never been observed to be able to be fully contained in one subject. If size and mass are in question, the entity will make use of anything it is capable of.

SCP-711 has shown the ability to effect “thought-control” within a subject, where it can compel them to look at it.

After the subject is told to refuse SCP-711 contact, SCP-711 will, using the new entity, bark a horrific scream and stare at the subject, screaming “Help me” in Russian, and then only emits its voice.

If the subject is not in contact with SCP-711, the entity will swiftly grow in size until the subject’s thoughts become loud and screaming. Once the subject does not obey, SCP-711 will stop, and SCP-711-4 will appear out of the corner of SCP-711’s eye. SCP-711-4 will be sitting on SCP-711, and will repeat the exact phrase in Russian.

The entity will then disappear.
