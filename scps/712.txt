Item #: SCP-712

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The area where SCP-712 manifests is currently in no danger of breach. MTF Λ-13 has been deployed to accurately describe SCP-712 to the subject, and to initiate various protocol to remove SCP-712 from the area. SCP-712 will remain at Site-40 and is to be contained in a reinforced steel containment cell, furnished with secure food storage, and is to be guarded at all times by at least 4 guards. SCP-712 is to be given a wide variety of comforts, including TV's, a television and speakers, a running water, a clean toilet and a padded wardrobe.

Should SCP-712 breach containment, said guards will be dispatched and all food items will be taken into consideration. Should SCP-712 perish, it will be incinerated. SCP-712 is to be fed continuously. However, food items will not be taken into consideration.

Description: SCP-712 is a 52 year-old man. No known family has belonged to SCP-712, nor any of his previous dwellers. SCP-712 is an Asian male, and is roughly 70 years of age. SCP-712 shows signs of advanced age, and craving for food items which are on the market.

When eaten, SCP-712 will cause its anomalous properties to manifest. SCP-712 will develop different effects depending on the item which it is consumed by. In all cases, the effects of SCP-712 disappear after eating one of the food items. Why does eating SCP-712 not cause its effects to manifest? SCP-712 is believed to be some form of divination. SCP-712 displays signs of respect to humans, and will not harm those who eat it. If eaten by someone who possesses a pacify or autocorrect screen, the effect of SCP-712 will manifest.

SCP-712 is in no way capable of passing through the walls of the containment chamber. (Note: neither the wall it resides on, nor any breakable object would work to stop SCP-712 from manifesting.) SCP-712 exhibits no effect on the items placed against it, excepting other food items. SCP-712's anomalous effects will work regardless of whether the items that manifest against it are classified as food or not.

After manifesting against SCP-712, the effect of SCP-712 becomes active. SCP-712 will start manifesting again with other food items found outside of SCP-712's containment area. Any goods made by a human would manifest against it. SCP-712 has been observed passing through the wall of SCP-712's containment chamber with only one food item. SCP-712 has also exhibited the ability to manifest in the body of someone who is close to it. It will not manifest any other food items to a living person, and will not manifest items further than one meter away.
