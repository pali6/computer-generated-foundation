Item #: SCP-724

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-724 must be kept containing a minimum of five (5) metric tonnes of expired programmable matter in order to prevent SCP-724 from entering its primary anomalous site. The primary site is to be monitored using the Thermonuclear Detector (TEST) and is to be located on a ravine somewhere within a five kilometer radius. The primary site is also to be furnished with a fuel cell to contain at least one third of the required amount of fuel to fuel the primary Site. Personnel entering the primary site in its active state are to be immediately evacuated and hand over any electronic devices they may have on them in order to ensure they do not have their processor damaged.

When the primary Site is entered, a beam neutralisation pulse will be fired from an API Level 4 mobile radiation disruptor, followed by a firefight with several hundred (400) Foundation-employed personnel and remotely detonated array of sensors. Upon exiting the principal anomalous site, the Foundation radio contact will be lost and will have no further effect.

Should the targeted SCP is ever breached, the core of the containment chamber shall be disconnected and the main vortex shall be sent upwards of the target unit while the two secondary containment units will start to separate. If the core was not severed, the additional thruster systems will automatically extend to fill the portal.

Experiment Log: The following particular experiment was performed via the PRQ-30 series of devices with the first generation Thermonuclear Detector.

The following protocol was shown to be successful in successfully breaching all four core of SCP-724.

* Note: All items retrieved or destroyed have been incinerated as per standard incineration protocols.

PRQ-30-1:

The first test was conducted via the PRQ-30-4.
