Item #: SCP-732

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-732 is located in Site 8 and is to be guarded using armed guards at all times. The entrance to the basement of Site 8 must be barricaded off from the rest of the site.

Description: SCP-732 is a large circular storage unit, measuring approximately ten metres x ten metres. Access to SCP-732 by any living human is prohibited, and with any exceptions, the containment chamber must be locked from the outside. SCP-732 is initially empty, but after approximately three hours SCP-732 begins to move. After about a minute, SCP-732 begins to leave the containment chamber, breaking off the two overhangs and revealing the bottom of the space below. The following is a list of reasons SCP-732 is placed in, in order of discovery.

•Cleanliness. A small bank of armed guards are to be stationed outside the containment chamber, and workers are to be onsite to rake up dirt.
•Drastinative lighting. An ozone-free environment is to be maintained.
•Temperature. Moderate to high temperatures.
•Hazardous materials. All metal objects moved by SCP-732 are to be inspected for corrosion and to be placed into storage.
•Strong acids and gases. Chemical weapons.
•Small metal objects.
•Light. Low to medium intensity long-range illumination.
•Impossible/destructive atmosphere. High to medium intensity nighttime illumination.
•Dense heat. Low to medium intensity nuclear explosions.
•Impossible/destructive environment. High to medium intensity intermittent fog.
•Impossible/destructive materials. All metal objects placed in containment are to be checked for corrosion.
•Idunno.
•Fences.
•All solid objects.
•All furniture.
•All personnel.
•Assault weapons.
•Experimental safety measures.
•Durational procedures.
•Experimental services.
•Research, development, testing, maintenance, and research.

SCP-732 is supposedly a simple storage unit. Rather than being constructed of earth it appears to be made of many layers of steel and painted with many different colours. Any materials deposited into SCP-732 contain a vast number of small black diamonds embedded into it. The diamonds appear to be of unknown composition, but they are made up of various materials. On the back of SCP-732 the following message is found:
