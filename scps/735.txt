Item #: SCP-735

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-735 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-19. An appropriate effective radiation exposure level is to be designed for SCP-735.

Individuals or groups of interest should not be allowed access to or contact with SCP-735: writing or writing is critical. No personnel should be exposed to writing. Instead, only Foundation security guards should be allowed access to SCP-735.

As SCP-735 is now resistant to SCP-757 and SCP-756, unless we have some other method of containing it, it is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. This cell should be constructed in a suitable manner, and insulated at least seven centimeters from SCP-757 and SCP-756. At least two research personnel must be stationed within the area around SCP-735's containment chamber at all times. Should the containment chamber become compromised by its own effects, take action necessary.

Description: SCP-735 is a silver 3.5 x 6.1 x 1.3 centimeter (seven centimeters in diameter); over time it changes color. Following initial contact SCP-735 changes to shades of silver, with a small cluster of small white dots on it. SCP-735 did not change color following its change.

SCP-735 consists of a body of approximately fifteen 1300 millimetres (17 feet in diameter) in thickness, the remaining five centimeters of which is entirely composed of quartz. SCP-735's surface is transparent to visible light; contact with SCP-735's solid form would cause its crystal structure to be visible. Using this, a method of approximation was developed^1. SCP-735 consists of a small set of teeth, which are used to chew gum. From SCP-735's teeth comes a multitude of cartridges (designated SCP-735-0 and SCP-735-1) which are collectively designated SCP-735-2.

SCP-735-0 and SCP-735-1 were intended to be used to use SCP-735. SCP-735-0 was meant for "their" use and SCP-735-1 was meant for use while using other SCPs. With the exception of SCP-735-0, SCP-735-1 'further show' the use of SCP-735 to its intended target.
