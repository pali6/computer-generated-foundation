Item #: SCP-738

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-738-1 are to be left in containment in a separate compartment for use only in testing.

D-Class who acquire SCP-738-3 by or from any third party are to be immediately taken into custody and rounded up for processing. As SCP-738-3 can be removed almost immediately, there is no need to immediately seize all SCP-738-3 instances. All units containing SCP-738-3 must be immediately dismantled and transported to Site-17 for incineration.

Description: SCP-738-1 are the remains of deceased individuals, typically of between 30 and 50 years of age, dated back to ████ years. Only one of these individuals has been found to have any known DNA of any kind. SCP-738-1 are irregularly shaped, as if produced by an unknown process, and appear to be precision made. Occasionally, SCP-738-1 trigger anomalous effects that cause them to point downwards.

SCP-738-1 appear to be sentient and are able to communicate with each other, however the specifics of how SCP-738-1 communicate are unknown. They are capable of creating a small increase in the height of the surrounding area, however are incapable of performing any kind of physical movement on the surrounding area.

The exact function of SCP-738-1 beyond reproduction is unknown. It is unclear whether SCP-738-1 actively hunt, kill, or are responsible for their own deaths, however the reason for doing this is unknown.

SCP-738-1 live in a number of cluttering areas, and are marked with various markers. SCP-738-1 will back away from the source of any form of communication, and will stand and stare at any personnel that comes close enough to walk next to them. In some cases, these individuals have been reported as frustrated and/or angry. SCP-738-1 will attempt to grab any and all objects that are close to their feet, including but not limited to simple objects such as wooden blocks, books, cookware, etc.

SCP-738-1 will create their own weapons when the opportunity arises. These weapons are essentially weapons of mass destruction, though when these weapons are fired correctly, they will inflict no damage upon the target.

If an individual is killed by SCP-738-1, they will be unable to move and will die. SCP-738-1 will then wake up again within two minutes of being killed, and will attack whoever came to hand them the artifact. While SCP-738-1 may attempt to "take" a human, the person only dies of their own hands. The individual may know the location of the artifact, but when they return and face anything that was clearly alive, the marks and marks on them will disappear.

It was found that human graves are significantly less likely to yield SCP-738-1, even when there is nothing other than a corpse in the ground. It is unknown if SCP-738-1 perceive humans in a non-conventional way, or if they are aware of the body's decomposition.

Addendum-738-1: Documentation about SCP-738-3 have been omitted for brevity. Only one instance has been recovered thus far.
