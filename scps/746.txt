Item #: SCP-746

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-746 is to be kept on its original base in a standard storage locker.

Description: SCP-746 is a 2m tall wooden round desk. Several small incisions have been made into its surface. The desk is covered in an irregular collection of photographs. SCP-746's history of its initial discovery is unknown.

SCP-746 was purchased in the laboratory of ██████ ██████ by a former acquaintance. The note describing the photograph on the desk was written in the same language as the photograph, and in the same handwriting, parents of SCP-746.

Addendum 746-01:

The calmer laboratory environment, in which the portrait was stored, is unchanged.

The portrait was donated to the Foundation by the mother.

Addendum 746-02:

SCP-746’s anomalous effect has been observed to manifest in photographs taken at the same exact moment as the photograph itself.

Addendum 746-03:

When one or more photographs are captured by SCP-746, the other photographs are unaffected.
