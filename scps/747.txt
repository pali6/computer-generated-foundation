Item #: SCP-747

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Due to SCP-747's effect, no multiple containment procedures are necessary.

Description: SCP-747 is a glass vase, measuring 2.5m in diameter and 1.1m in depth, each side painted with a dark blue color.

SCP-747 is completely filled with liquid, and when fully submerged and worn SCP-747 will transform into a humanoid shape. When this transformation occurs, the SCP-747 is capable of making vocalisations, though the exact nature of these vocalisations is currently unknown.

SCP-747 is able to express sexual expression, whilst communicating with other SCP-747 instances. At this time, 30% of all recorded instances are capable of human speech, though while conversing SCP-747 instances are able to change their appearance, they make no vocalisations. In addition, SCP-747 is completely immobile, and can only be opened by the insertion of a tool of sufficient strength into its container.

Every SCP-747 instance is able to respond to the voice of the SCP-747 Operator, by speaking, writing or otherwise communicating in a language almost exclusively spoken in the region of SCP-747's manifestation.

Note: SCP-747 originated in ██████████, ██████ and was recovered in ███████████ by the British Museum.

Addendum: SCP-747 was recovered in ██████████, ██ from ███████████ Museum Opal. Prior to its discovery, it was in the custody of a human female living in ██████████.

In the event of an SCP-747 instance being used for non-anomalous purposes, the SCP-747 Operator will speak to the subject, speak to the subject chanting in a language the subject understands shortly before they equally refuse the SCP-757 Operator's requests.

The SCP-747 Operator's voice, however, is completely inaudible to most humans.

Note: The effects of this feature were discovered in southern Arizona shortly after the discovery of SCP-747's location on ██████████.

Once the SCP-747 is used to speak a language that the subject understands, they will begin to function as a replacement by using their own voice. This will always prevent them from entering SCP-747's container, as SCP-747 will stop speaking to them.

Once the subject speaks, the SCP-747 Operator will speak telepathically, and speak using the subject's language and understanding. The subject will always remain silent, except in response to the SCP-747 Operator.

Note: SCP-747 can be used to explain its functions. As the SCP-747 Operator will never speak, the SCP-747 example can be used for communication with the SCP-747 Operator.

Addendum: SCP-747 was recovered in██████████ from ███████████ Museum Opal.
