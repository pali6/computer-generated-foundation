Item #: SCP-748

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-748 is to be contained within a 13m x 13m x 5m polyurethane activated containment cell. The temperature of the chamber can be kept within the range of 25C to 35C. The temperature of the chamber must be maintained within a 320C to 360C range.

Description: SCP-748 appears to be a cylindrical array of proton gold, with a diameter of 11m (5 ft). The anomalous properties of this object, emanating from its stage 1 state, claim to have been realised following the having of an incident with SCP-748's initial containment. The following was recorded after this incident (which has been reproduced for non-anomalous SCP objects).

00:03 - Donor is informed of the purpose of the red object and what it is intended for.

00:11 - Red object is brought into view.

00:14 - Red object takes on the appearance of a man in an incident 6 of SCP-748's 2nd stage.

00:20 - When the red object causes the red object to extend to the observer, the object disappears, and a single white light is emitted from the observer, other than the red object, then immediately passes through the observer and enters their body and is immediately transported to their destination.

00:23 - The observer is transported to a waiting red object.

00:24 - When the red object is brought into view, the observer experiences a 3-4 second-long black minute-long period of time where they are unable to react to anything in their environment.

00:25 - The red object manifests itself again and continues directly to the observer.

00:27 - Red object materialises within their full range of vision, or their peripheral vision.

00:30 - Red object takes on the appearance of an older man who is dying.
