Item #: SCP-749

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-749 is to be contained at Site-52 in a 4x4x4 square room.

SCP-749's components have been designated as Containment-Class Components. These components are to be kept in a standard, labeled storage locker in Containment-54's main containment area. All Components are to be removed from Containment-54 after each occurrence of SCP-749.

Description: SCP-749 is a 1m tall gold-plated tumbler, with the anomalously affected components arranged in a sequence of 4 identical pieces (herein designated as Components). SCP-749 is capable of projecting a pseudopipalion (Î©), resembling a bell shape, over each component and its intersection with each other. SCP-749 was discovered during a Foundation raid on a local jewelry shop. The bell was found to be made of white gold.
