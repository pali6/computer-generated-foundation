Item #: SCP-751

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-751 is to be kept in a standard L Class storage vault not to exceed 20 ft x 20 ft. x 15 ft.

Description: SCP-751 is a small, unmarked wooden vessel of 1.9 cubic meters total volume, measuring 3.8 by 3.8 by 3.8 meters. SCP-751 appears to be made of wood and contains no other anomalous properties.

SCP-751 was discovered on 10/5/19██ in a ████████ motel located in ████, Ohio, after several calls were received from a room where the owner of the device had refused to answer questions about the contents of SCP-751's contents.

Over the next three months, several similar devices were recovered from various other motel, boarding houses, and bars. Several of these devices were found near the center of the site of the incident.

At issue with the Foundation regarding SCP-751 is that it may have been intended to forcibly remove people out of a room. This is the focus of a separate experiment. -Dr. █████

Object #: SCP-1171

Object Class: Fire-resistant, corrosive, and toxic

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1171 is currently kept in a High-Ectamperance-Protection Vault at Site-42. Current research into using SCP-1171 to prevent or discourage the occurrence of high-energy material events is ongoing.

Description: SCP-1171 is a 6.25cm long, 3-feather jet airplane fan manufactured under a brand code matching the flight service and security clearance of a Level 3 Officer working with the U.S. Air Force. The company name is "American Aircraft" and has a surreptitious registered address inside the former owner's modest-sized apartment in █████, ████.

Using SCP-1171 on the air trip to ██████, ████, ██ manifests as the second passenger. SCP-1171 is more than 40m long at its widest point. The base of the aircraft is approximately 1.5m above ground level.

The pilot, seated in the side panel of SCP-1171 before launching, is identified by the characteristic sound of the jet rung. After the shockwave, SCP-1171's engines begin to make a jarring noise as the airplane races into the air.

At its maximum altitude and speed, SCP-1171's engine begins generating its own soundwaves and is audible for a space of 1.7 seconds.

In the corner, SCP-1171 creates a rumbling noise and glows cyan colour/light. At the next face of the tower, it pulls into the air and sends the jet aircraft's wings about 10m away. SCP-1171, rapidly losing altitude and speed, then collapses onto the ground and catches up with a nearby hillside. SCP-1171 is dragged away by helicopters.

It is unclear how many times SCP-1171 has been used, and the only recorded incidents have resulted in the destruction of the device by an alpha suit.

Object #: SCP-1208

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1208 is to be kept in a standard L Class storage vault not to exceed 20 ft x 20 ft. x 15 ft.

Description: SCP-1208 is a large, unmarked wax-paper box with an inner surface of 1.3 cubic meters. SCP-1208's interior is the only real physical object, and supernaturally resists any form of damage and damage that SCP-1208 could cause.

It is officially thought that SCP-1208 was meant to destroy is non-living material, and in reality it would be destroyed by its intended purpose.

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1290 is to be kept in a standard L Class storage vault not to exceed 20 ft x 20 ft. x 15 ft.

Description: SCP-1290 is a 2.5 litre carbonated milk jug with a single thick nipple attached. The contents of SCP-1290 are liquid (both solid and liquid), and do not form in water. SCP-1290 fits with any object installed in the container, and will disappear when the container is removed.
