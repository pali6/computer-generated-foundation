Item #: SCP-760

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-760 is to be contained within a large, reinforced concrete box of 12 by 12 meters. It should be supplied with electrical power, a power outlet to its left side, and a power outlet to its right. Onsite personnel should not enter the box without permission from testing personnel or one of its clients.

Description: SCP-760 was found in an undisclosed, damp cellar in [DATA EXPUNGED]. The cellar is filled with a solid, opaque, and ever-present underground atmosphere, similar in texture and smell to a basement. The conditions of the house's interior, including the contents of the basement, have not changed since it was built. The basement's contents, however, have changed.

SCP-760 is able to reproduce in any living or dead inhabitants of the house, in the same way that any individual can reproduce in a living human subject. This effect spreads only when any living organism enters the house. Where living organisms do not enter the house, however, the sample of SCP-760 that would normally affect the living organisms jumps to the living organism. If the living organism that would normally be affected by the effects are already inside the house, however, SCP-760 will not affect them until they are placed inside the house.

SCP-760 can also reproduce corpses. (SCP-760 does not need a living being to reproduce corpses.) When this occurs, any living organisms capable of reproduction will be affected by the effects of the sample of SCP-760 that was originally created by SCP-760. At the same time, all living creatures that would normally be affected by the effects of the sample of SCP-760 will be affected by the effects of the sample of SCP-760.

SCP-760 was discovered in the catalogue of [REDACTED] during a raid on the warehouse for [REDACTED]. It was identified as the work of the organisation "Fuck Off Yours Productions" and contained, along with several other objects of interest, before the agents were repatriated.

Addendum 760-1: The use of SCP-760 by a non-human organism for [REDACTED] was prohibited by O5 command.

Addendum 760-3: The findings of Research Branch Agent Lucia Petrie

Research Branch Agent Lucia Petrie, [REDACTED]

Upon discovering SCP-760's effects, Agent Lucia Petrie immediately began blowing. SCP-760's effects were not transmitted until after Agent Petrie had completed her first blow, at which point the effects started manifesting.

Once an affected instance of SCP-760 was destroyed, the second SCP-760 would appear in its place.

Addendum 760-4: On field tests, all SCP-760 samples were contained, with the exception of one, and the scares of Agent Petrie flaring up at any attempt to bring them in to test.

Addendum 760-5: SCP-760's effect on [REDACTED]

Addendum 760-6: Curated marks of [REDACTED].

Addendum 760-10: ICSUT 05-A (La Aphelion)

Addendum 760-11: On field tests, SCP-760 was discovered to be capable of producing a long-term calming effect before the experiments could be carried out.

Addendum 760-12: [DATA EXPUNGED]

Addendum 760-13: SCP-760 was found to be capable of causing an adverse affect outside its containment area.

Addendum 760-14: On field tests, it was found to be capable of producing a similar effect before conducting the field administration.

Addendum 760-15: On field tests, it was discovered that SCP-760 could cause a similar effect before conducting the field administration.

Addendum 760-15-1: Procedure for field testing of SCP-760

On field tests, field agent Lucia Petrie was instructed to hijack the passenger's seat of [REDACTED] aircraft and conduct the dosage and administration.[REDACTED]

Upon noticing the passenger was not aware of the purpose of the medication, she was instructed to drive at 70kph while attempting to shut down the autopilot at least once.

Upon noticing the passenger would not comply with the instructions, she was instructed to drive at 65kph while attempting to shut down the autopilot at least once.

Upon reaching the desired speed, agents were instructed to accelerate by [REDACTED] while attempting to turn left at the intersection with North Tranmere Road.

Upon reaching the desired speed, agents were instructed
