Item #: SCP-765

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-765 is to be contained within a Type-3 Containment Cell at Site-34. The cell is to be furnished with the materials for a standard humanoid containment. A standard feeding schedule is to be provided to SCP-765's cell.

SCP-765 is kept in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-34.

Samples of SCP-765's skin are to be taken from the arm of SCP-765's cell.

Description: SCP-765 is a female humanoid of at least 20 years of age, of a European appearance and of African descent. SCP-765 is dressed in an orange jumpsuit with a flag of various nations sewn onto each sleeve. The standard configuration of the cap affords enough protection to allow contact with said skin.

SCP-765 has a personality that is able to speak English and understand written language. SCP-765 is also able to understand and write Latin as well. SCP-765 has also proven able to speak English as well.

SCP-765 will attempt to communicate with its cell, in English, in exchange of food and beverages and knowledge of various humanoid anomalies.

SCP-765 will occasionally occasionally attempt contact with humans as well. SCP-765 will never attempt contact with humans, as it will only communicate in Latin. An ongoing calculation and evaluation has shown that the probability of an interaction between a living organism and a living entity^1 is 23% and 13% respectively.

The Foundation is currently attempting to locate the cell that SCP-765 is currently in after multiple attempts to track it. All attempts to locate the cell have been unsuccessful.

Addendum: SCP-765's cell is currently in Foundation custody. Attempts to locate and contact the cell are ongoing.

Addendum: SCP-765 has not been seen interacting with other humans since its containment. Attempts to interact with other humans are ongoing.
