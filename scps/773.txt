Item #: SCP-773

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-773 is kept in Level 3 Containment Area-12 at Site-362. Personnel are to observe a near constant diet of ketchup on all surfaces in SCP-773's containment area, which is then to be recycled.

Description: SCP-773, formerly Mr. Fish and Mr. Peanut, is a 52-year-old human male dressed in a red bear costume, and who is said to possess the ability to "secretively teleport things to you", although he has denied this to Foundation personnel. SCP-773 has no physical, biological, or psychological abnormalities. In addition, SCP-773 has also been observed to have a taste of ketchup on his dress, as well as being able to transform into any three instances of SCP-682. SCP-773 is said to be "adamentably attractive" and memories of his childhood has been erased, but evidence suggests he had a few friends:

•Foundation Records: Mr. Fish was found in his home in Brooklyn, New York, regretting that he had seen an actor's performance of "The Scent of Recolouration" by Albert Nobog, calling him a "scary maniac behind his back".
•Address:

•Location: Site-362
•Personnel Dossier: Dr. Lauren Dooley
•History: SCP-682 and SCP-773 were found in the house of Dr. Dooley, who was known to regularly throw out foul graffiti and write awesome stupid bios of people who should know better than her "addiction" or "abuse", but it's been a while since last we saw her.

Or, maybe she just liked my work already.

I guess I've given up trying to find her.

Perhaps the only thing left to do is take care of all this stuff, since my work is stolen from other people's work...

I'm jealous.

- Dr. Dooley

SCP-783 was not discovered and contained by any other Foundation personnel until 1943, when it was being studied by the ████████ ██████████ ██████████████, and was unavailable to the Foundation until 1953.

Addendum SCP-773-1: Doctor Dooley and Dr. Dooley's notes on all their such SCP-783 related experiments and notes are as follows:

Dr. Dooley had a few ideas, but was really stuck on "puppy science" and seemed to stand out like a sore thumb.
