Item #: SCP-78

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-78 is to be kept in a standard safe-class container. Testing of SCP-78 is to be conducted only with direct, written permission from Level 7 or higher personnel.

Discovery: SCP-78 was discovered on █-th-██-1984 in ███████ Candy Corporation's storage wing. Over the weekend, the company's anomalous stockpile of these candies reached full capacity. Its effects are currently unknown, as the candy is identical to any other variety except for its anomalous properties.

Some say that SCP-78 is valuable. Others, however, do not agree. Some say that all those who have seen it are ghosts, or others say that it is a beautiful piece of art, while others say it is a cruel joke. In either case, it has produced its own merchandise.

Description: SCP-78 is an unbranded plastic candy cake with a design resembling a chocolate cup. The product is not composed of sugar or other carbonating substances, instead, of a single baked egg that has been ground into a smooth paste.
