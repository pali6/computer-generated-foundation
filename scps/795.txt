Item #: SCP-795

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: All references to SCP-795 in our Mind-Workings are currently being denied by the Information Ministry. In light of the O+-Class Student Insertion Criteria, all available information is being ironed out of the Foundation's database. In addition, although the classification order is to be F+ to B+, all records relating to SCP-795 are being premined. This will only be effective until further notice. If SCP-795 is reapplied, all material about the subject, including texts or other public documents about the subject, will be deemed Class C revoked, and research will be suspended. Additionally, the base security guard at the Subjects on Site ███ (currently Dr. Kevin Hollisters) will need to be notified and reassigned to a post-doctoral position elsewhere.

Under this order, all materials relating to SCP-795 are to be designated Class C and are to be stored in Safe on the Site ███. Nevertheless, Class C information is going to be stored at Site-██, to avoid creep-out issues in other locations.

Regarding possible implications of Class C activity, I advise all mental health professionals that do the diagnosis of Primary 2 and Secondary 2 types of Survivors be reported to the PHP. After all, secondary memories are relatively benign. Counsel, we are not asking you to like secondary memories, only remove them.

Incident Preston's Tags
Date of Containment: ██/██/████

Notes: The Primary alleged to be abducted on ██/██/████. It is possible that this was not the same person as the Secondary.
Date of Containment: ██/██/████

Manifestation Location: Site ███

Notes: At this time, I am unsure which, if any, other records regarding Primary 2 and Secondary 2 are correct. SCP-██4 was trying to retrieve Primary 2, and secondary memories regarding Primary 2 are unclear.
Date of Containment: ██/██/████

Manifestation Location: Site ███

Notes: Since we have no leads regarding the whereabouts and previous states of the Brigadier, I am advising that all information regarding Primary 2 be reclassified as Keter. Containment will be reestablished as soon as possible.
Date of Containment: 1/██/████

Manifestation Location: Site-██

Notes: Due to the nature of the Brigadier, we are not asking you to deploy. However, it was preferable to have the Lt. Colonel handle the continuing of Primary 2 memories of the Brigadier, unfortunately.
Date of Containment: 1/██/████

Manifestation Location: Site ███

Notes: You can allow Main 2 Secondary 3 to be reclassified as Keter. However, I recommend that no attempt be made to remove Primary 2 memory of the Brigadier from the data, for reasons I have outlined.
Date of Containment: 1/██/████

Manifestation Location: Site ███

Notes: This is extremely premature, and irresponsible in terms of the Brigadier. It is also extremely low impact. However, the Brigadier was ordered to be returned to the Brigadier's Foundation, and I hope this will not result in the Brigadier going up for parole.
Date of Containment: 1/██/████

Manifestation Location: Exploration log of SCP-██4 d-Class personnel, ████████, ████████.
Date of Containment: ██/██/████

Notes: The Brigadier is talented, a natural leader, and a lot of people around him. She was, at least, an okay leader, though. More importantly, she was calm, but actually helped out a few issues before it got to the numbers.
Date of Containment: ██/██/████

Notes: C'mon, I don't want Elaine to be the next Brigadier. That's a lot of paperwork and paperwork for a new employee, even if her personality seems good enough. Maybe try to bring her to the top. Or help her out with Viola and Furione?
Date of Containment: 1/██/████

Notes: I need to hear what Dr. Mittag says. We have some TU-Class Interests that don't sit well with him. But just one more issue to report to me in the next little while.
Date of Containment: ██/██/████

Notes: Brenda's still Ayn is here, Schrida Bitch. Don't even think about you giving any of those guys on the Extremis one-upping you.
Date of Containment: 1/██/████

Notes: I believed he was being helped out. But the Brigadier never talks at all.
