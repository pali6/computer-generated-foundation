Item #: SCP-803

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of SCP-803, its intrinsic effects are difficult to predict. Foundation units conducting research are to monitor local police for additional reports of instances. Towns where SCP-803 has not been observed may be visited or searched until they are suspect. If a possible encounter is confirmed, a cover story concerning an incident in an unlikely location is to be filed with local police. The nearest hospital should be used for observation. If SCP-803 is suspected a major threat to the safety of citizens, the Foundation will observe itself as the responsible party.

Due to the contentious nature of SCP-803, local governments and military power should be used in conjunction. Mobile Task Force Zeta-13 (ID.#632f5bbb2d) is to fight in an effort to contain all instances of the anomaly. Instances may be captured via conventional means if one remains active for longer than 5 weeks.

Description: SCP-803 is the effect of an anomalous growth of mass on human facial features. SCP-803 affects all human subjects. Normal facial growth becomes immobile and distorted. Areas affected by the anomaly form under its effects, which shift between time and place throughout the subject's face.

Because transparent, rigid, sclera-shaped and normal facial structures are impenetrable with certain features, subject is gripped by the anomaly over all major lines and blending / blending is undetectable. Failure of containment or mis-hack should lead to an indefinite detainment process for non-lethal non-anomalous means.

This is not a complete list of anomalies affected by SCP-803. For a full list, refer to Document SCP-803-903-A.
