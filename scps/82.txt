Item #: SCP-82

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-82 is to be contained in a standard containment chamber with no limit on its physical size, but otherwise allowed free access to whatever areas (including the kitchen) it is allowed to reach.

Any personnel who enter the containment chamber with SCP-82's containment key are to be individually reassigned as necessary.

Description: SCP-82 is a thin rubber ring, approximately 1cm in diameter, with a diameter of 1.0cm. Its anomalous properties seem to be directly related to the number of fingers. The core wears out at the rate of roughly half an hour of constant use, and the "finger" inside always ends around the centre point.

The only observable effect of SCP-82's anomalous properties is a repetitive, unbroken beat of repetitive sounds in which the ambient sound of the surrounding environment is continually altered. The noise consists of a number of variations in the composition of repeated cycles of note-changing, in which the usual patterns of five major scales (harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, acoustic, and harmonic) are repeated from the standard of the guitar. The rhythmic patterns are too fast compared to the harmonic patterns, and melt into the noise when repeated too fast.

The melodic patterns consist of notes played in successive spaces. The period of the melodic sequences (from quarter to eighth) is intentionally large; it coincides perfectly with the beat, syncopated with the note, and repeats in any time signature. However, the melodic patterns are so fast that the bass frequencies of the guitar center around the midline rather than above.

These melodic patterns include phrases such as "the water came up in a various angle," "the coolness of the air" and "this direction's the right one-degree". The notation is specific in both quantity and content, with the end of every phrase being preceded by the semitone (1 sem) followed by the second note of the second scale.

The melodies that comprise these melodic patterns can be easily and predictably overridden with the correct set of actions.

This anomalous effect occurs at phrases that begin with "a", "b", or "c", at any note and at any fret combination. This effect is unaffected by accents on scales, which, when counted, first make the entire scale note. At the end of "c", the semitone ends and the second fret plays the end of the second string, followed by the eighth note on the scale. This action is repeated from the beginning of the string to the end of the first fret.

The following information is present on the guitar. It is possible to add more notes to the guitar, by adding the "mutes" on the chromatic scales. Notes that play on the fretboard are highlighted on the copy page and can be added by clicking the "Add Additional Note" button next to the digital entry. In other words, you can adapt the notes on the guitar to be played different ways on the guitar.
