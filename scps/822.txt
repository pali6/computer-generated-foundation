Item #: SCP-822

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-822 is to be inomically contained at Bio-Research Area-140, within a quarantine room fitted with six electrically-activated doorways. All members of the high-risk SCP-822-SP are to be placed in a randomly-selected multiplex dumailer module and manually manually triggered when contact is lost.

Entry and's of the containment cell are to take place only through a high-strength escort helicopter. Serving is not authorized for this purpose.

SCP-822’s labyrinthine path is to be sabotaged and/or tampered with. Any areas of SCP-822 that may be circumvented are to be bypassed.

Description: SCP-822 is a large field of an unknown composition caused by a resonance occurring in a vacuum, approximated at about 6.6% of the ambient level of the vicinity. It measurably blocks atmospheric absorption, with a subsea radio-frequency interceptor system.

SCP-822 ruins and shakes when uncovered in water. It is theorized to cause large-scale warp anomalies by correcting the parallax of water in which it is suspended. The lack of response decreases with more energy (and saturation) from the onboard pressure sensors, the pressure levels being flat at a constant reading between 0 and 0.2psi, though by the hour-point, a radius that decays into water starts to dissipate. Large areas affected by this ████████ property are to be covered, and no electric generators are to be used.

SCP-822 has been nicknamed "The Darkness" or "Newspis". No other anomalous phenomena have been observed elsewhere in the entity’s area of effect.

SCP-822 cannot be moved or dismantled; objects or residents inside are generally reproducible at no cost to anyone outside observation. It is theorized that this is eventually resolved by evousing the probe ready to sense the miniaturized displacement of water from the affected location, activating the debris field, or just burying it.

We can watch a phenomenon in progress, we can read its shape and write about it, we can move it and see what it’s doing. It’s easy to miss so much of such a dramatic institution as this."

Dec. 8, 2008 Structure assigned involves an aqueous substance with a large
impact zone, which may have two regions of effect, with three large
impact zones. There is some controversy regarding whether or
