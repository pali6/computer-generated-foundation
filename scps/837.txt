Item #: SCP-837

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-837 is currently stored in a standard high security storage locker in Site-18. Staff working with the object must use both written and textual protocols to prevent staff from writing SCP-837.

All SCP-837 article articles are to be uploaded to the SCP.net wiki. Be sure to always put the quote marks around the article, because hotkeyed wiki articles won't get read.

No articles that get multiple comments are allowed permissions to get multiple creators' author pages. You must have a minimum of 3 staff members do it.

The article must have the end-of-article tag at the vanishing. You may specify other end-of-article tags at your own discretion.

A link to the completed SCP-837 article on the SCP.net wiki MUST be provided as an edge comment along with the completed article document. If you have constructive critique available you should obtain it.

Note: When commenting on another article you MUST use the #wikidot #site-18 topic counterpart.

Workaround: You must put the comments into the comments and the link is up. Go to the page and put the comment tags in the comment box and make sure they read via the system's comment page. Move onto the next page and make sure you put your comments all at once and do the same for the next.

Contributors! If you'd like to contribute to the development of the site, feel free to make a post on Chris' frontpage. You could also write the article on your side and be considered for the Workaround.

If you have a suggestion, please make sure it's an idea, and provide proper structure for it. For example, an author page, dedication, and one of the below current FAQ's does not work for 5 or 5+.
