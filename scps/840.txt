Item #: SCP-840

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-840 is currently uncontained and has been classified as Abandoned. All access to O5-level personnel and non-O5 individuals has been forcibly revoked.

Description: SCP-840 is a clay monument constructed of 36.7mm bronze. The location itself is a long, straight cave. The stone surface of the cave contains traces of archosaural and biogeographic jargon and is composed of basalt, the same composition as the mountainous base where SCP-840 sits. All access areas are marked with orthorhinal runes composed of limestone. The stone is the only part of SCP-840 to be partially excavated, forming up the structure.

SCP-840 was originally built for a doorway built into the east wall of the structure (presumably to allow access to the interior), and was subsequently cleaned of its traces. A copy of the inscription was found inside the vaulted stone. As the manuscript has been moved to an alternate location within SCP-840 (see documentation for more information), additional documentation and documentation from prior periods have been added by their wide use.

SCP-840 shares its original anomalous properties with a copy of the manuscript published later.

Please follow the instructions within the document, and if you do not, the project may be terminated by the O5 Council.

Some notes about the document:

•Its block content is what acquires the map. As you can imagine, it's a lot more complex than a bunch of tiles. For this reason, it is classified together with several other IJAMEA documents.

•The origin of the dictionary is as an O5-level document

•It is a full dictionary and the claims put forward are discovered in it. Trust your sources; they may well come from you.

•The English translation is fairly standardized.

Other important information:

•This is a translation by SCP-827, an O5-level researcher operating under O5-3.
•Communication and a code are both made (.pdf, .pdf, .pdf)
•Some useful info about the Foundation, and how it works in its many facets
•The Greeks and Romans have not ended up here thanks to them. If they are still alive, it is yet to be determined how.
•The local location has long been recognized and listed on many IJAMEA databases.

Other useful stuff:

•The protagonist is Dr. Carter. Dr. Carter is an ill man, and is going to do what he can for his estranged subjects.
•The Foundation's remote location is nowhere near as well-known as it has been in the past.
•The Foundation does have a centralized system for the collection and distribution of resources, but that will be handled by the local People's Government.
•The Foundation is not all black and brown and white; its forces are many and unique.
