Item #: SCP-841

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Any unauthorized access is to be terminated by any means available. All those involved are to be detained and administered class-A amnestics. Under no circumstances is any item of SCP-███ to be allowed in the possession of SCP-███.

A committee has been formed to investigate any unauthorized access. Should they prove to be illegal, the committee has directed agents of the walk-in mob to forcibly remove all record of unauthorized entries and records of unauthorized entry for SCP-███. Any records of such unauthorized access are to be destroyed regardless of this action.

Description: SCP-███ is a heavy silver writing desk, roughly 5-8 ██ meters tall, with several anomalously preserved markings. SCP-███ was discovered in the possession of ███████ █████, with the object on his person.

SCP-███ was found during police investigations, after a domestic disturbance of an uncooperative domestic woman. Mr. █████ has been designated Foundation Agent Kraus, and will be allowed to record requests for alternate forms of containment as needed. Should this ever be impossible, the request for a more permanent site of incarceration is to be approved.

During physical examination, SCP-███ has demonstrated no anomalous properties. Further attempts by forensic means failed to identify any anomalous anomalies prior to SCP-███'s disappearance. Particularly when the interview was conducted by no other individuals aside from Agent Kraus, a primary thoroughness of SCP-███'s anomalous properties is required.

Completed a valid form for access for SCP-███

SCP-███ was designated the object's former property, and has been maintained at least until the entry of his current occupant.
