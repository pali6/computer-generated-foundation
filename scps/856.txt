ASSERVATION

SCP-856-1.png

The following document has led to the creation of a Misael Report. - O5-█

*Augreaux Applicables** (State key 1235-13)

The application to international entities designated as a super- resource invaluable for our society. As the foundation is at the beginning of the lowest ranked continent in our database, the application was deemed fair. The Foundation exprieved this privilege upon the acquisition of the [REDACTED] Project by doing nothing other than contest the finding of any other allegations against them.

We are perfectly happy to have you waive your application, and to offer to support the Foundation in this regard, and every one of our employees will apply our business mentality to the process.

We are very ready to sell the rights for the proper usage, and promise to, from throughout the world, extend our ASICSA license. We cannot afford to lose our organic business in this travel.

- O5-█

Main proponent of the proposal.
