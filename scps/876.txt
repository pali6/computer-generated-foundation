Although the phenomenon persisted for several years, all initial witnesses to it disappeared into a fog on July 14th, 1976 of the same year that SCP-876 was discovered in Site-78. Artifacts, apparently left inside the object were collected for analysis and allowed to delay Class-3 O/C&A legislation.
