Item #: SCP-896

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: In the event of a containment breach, all D-class personnel must be teleported to their assigned site. D-class Personnel #288-M747, so as to avoid further damages to Foundation property, must scan for potential security breaches.

Description: SCP-896 appears to be defined as "impossible standing in certain dimensions, surrounded by a rainbow of colours." SCP-896 has not been observed to move, change shape, or leave its vicinity at all times. When it is properly restrained, SCP-896 will attempt to retract its limbs and perform various motions that it deems necessary. When it is not naturally restrained, SCP-896 will attempt to steal items from Foundation personnel or otherwise restrain SCP-896. The actions of SCP-896 are build up to a point, and erupt gradually when SCP-896 is not restrained.
