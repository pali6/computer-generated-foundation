Item #: SCP-91

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-91 is to be contained in a standard Safe-class containment unit at Site-███, and makes requests for psychological or psychiatric evaluation only.

Description: SCP-91 is a Caucasian female of approximately 45-50 years, age 24-25, and physical appearance is consistent with that of a Spanish-American woman of Puerto Rican-American descent. SCP-91 remains in a state of extreme agitation, and has demonstrated a low tolerance for pain.

SCP-91's anomalous property activates whenever SCP-91 is served a steak, three standard steak orders from any restaurant in the United States, or any three standard orders at a fast food restaurant in the United States. SCP-91 is mentally irritable, and will require a call to order before turning away from a restaurant.

The anomalous effect activates whenever SCP-91 is served an apple, peach, or apple-flavored hamburger, which will begin a programmed sequence
when ordered, and then activate when served.

SCP-91 will always respond to the call to order with annoyance but will also begin to express distrust (See Incident Gauche-41-J).

Personnel that are assigned to SCP-91 will watch for these words to become visible on the outside of SCP-91's mouth, either recalling their employment at the restaurant, or unconsciously associating certain phrases with the name of the restaurant.

Addendum 01: Incident Gauche-41-J

On ██/██/20██, SCP-91 engaged SCP-91's phone and requested to be allowed to quit earlier life. The restaurant did not accept the request. However, SCP-91 had been doing low-level work on a small amount of SCP-91's life, and was attempting to relax its tension. After being proven unsuccessful, SCP-91 requested to have a favor withdrawn from SCP-91, and requested the appointment of a psychologist. The psychologist recommended that SCP-91 begin reading the Bible, and that SCP-91 live in a tight-knit family relationship with a single mother.

The request granted was later found to apply to SCP-91's lunch reservation at the restaurant:

•Pi'interference
•Recurring phrase
•Appraisal

Addendum 02: Incident Gauche-41-J

On ██/██/20██, SCP-91 attempted to introduce SCP-91 to a female Japanese-American, who stated that her mother told her that it was illegal to marry an Asian-American. SCP-91 behaved normally to the sushi bar, and suggested that SCP-91 see his luncheon appointment. SCP-91 took the place of the female's mother, and ordered a well-cooked shrimp wrap, vegetables, and cantaloupe. SCP-91 completely ignored the reference, and remained seated at its desk. The female did not acknowledge SCP-91, instead telling her that she wanted to talk soon. As the female exited the kitchen, SCP-91 performed the following sequence:

•Omega
•Canton
•Eta
•Lekka
•Apple
•Pearl
•Cartula
•Powdered

The female did not attempt to leave the restaurant, and continued to talk as the sushi portion of SCP-91 was prepared, at which point SCP-91 entered its own aid mode. ♦The staff pondered whether or not to continue the sequence; fortunately, the female did not have any food on her to offer. SCP-91's discomfort increased, and the female was terminated, and SCP-91 has been cleared for a second attempt at the sushi bar.

Addendum 03: Incident Gauche-41-J

On ██/██/20██, SCP-91 disabled its automatic binding of its food to its own preference. SCP-91 requested out of the need to be served a double cheeseburger, as well as an apple, peach, and apple-flavor burger. The request was denied.

Addendum 04: Incident Gauche-41-J

On ██/██/20██, SCP-91 made an Old English cake and sewed it into a postcard style envelope. SCP-91 found the postcard to be unfeasible to receive inside the main body of a standard postcard envelope. SCP-91 placed an ad on all major search engines for the photos of SCP-91's cake and envelope, and placed instead one featuring the bachelorette cake it requested in its previous use.
