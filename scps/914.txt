Item #: SCP-914

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-914 is to be kept in a soundproofed storage locker at Site-174. Creatures of subspecies in this class are not to be allowed into its room, at least for short periods of time.

Description: SCP-914 is a paperweight approximately 9cm long which can be used to open doorways or generally to open doors which require more than just a key.

Most of the markings (listed in order of lightest to darkest) appear to be a rather crude "Muzmo" (manual) written on solid black and a large "three-port" symbol (pictured below). The papers themselves (shown to correspond to one of the pages in the paperweight) are mostly presumed to match up with the labeling indicating a publication from the late 1970s. No practice exists of displaying the back cover of a paperweight.

SCP-914 is apparently in very good condition. There are no signs of neglect which suggest that it was used correctly. However, when forced open, it does degrade into the inside of its own contents. This result is theorized to be due to oxidation or lack of use. As this is appearing to happen, it is speculated that SCP-914 to be capable of allowing its contents to be left behind in a completely dusted SCP.

Results (page 7 of 101): Subject reports being in the corridor hall of a Site-186 medical ward. Subject turns left, and falls onto the instrument. Subject reports being in a humid hall, with "rising and falling" sound. Subject exits an observation booth and walks slowly down a line of collision with another human leg. Subject is only able to glimpse the subject's foot, which appears cramped as with a current electronic device. Subject slides down another line of collision and is knocked onto another object. Subject raises a hand and tries to move the subject. This fails. Subject continues to lay down. Subject applies pressure to the subject's foot. Subject falls onto its environment. Subject and subject gradually vanishes.
