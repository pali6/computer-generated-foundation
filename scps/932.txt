Item #: SCP-932

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-932 is to be stored in a secure locker at Site-92. Test-loggers are to keep it in a standard containment locker when not being tested. In light of the quick-tempo and comfortable design, human test participants may open the lid of SCP-932's containment locker in order to feed it dried fish. Containment procedures for SCP-932 still requires the use of:

1.A handheld marine drone.
2.A continuous group of five to ten test participants to facilitate the storage of dry fish.
3.A small pool of dried drier fish.
4.A small square crab bridge with a small gap between its front and back edges in order to allow doorway through.
5.A bright spotlight (controlled by the use of a remote control), with extends one meter up at time.

A usable sample of dried fish is currently forbidden. However, a safe baseline of dried fish can be collected from dry fish sections. The Foundation anticipates that dry fish particles will be removed before testing becomes needed.
