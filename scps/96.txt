Item #: SCP-96

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-96 is contained in a standard containment area, a reinforced glass window, and a personal electric fence. SCP-96 is to be available in its room at least three times per week, and is only to be allowed to use SCP-96's bathroom.

After leaving the containment area, SCP-96 is to be placed in its room with SCP-96.

Description: SCP-96's body is a humanoid, approximately 38cm tall, with black hair and blue eyes. SCP-96 is typically found wearing a blue shirt and blue jeans. SCP-96 is generally running around the house at least once a week, and will occasionally visit the house to keep track of activity. SCP-96 is always making ice cream.

SCP-96 usually offers ice cream sandwiches, but is not limited to delivering ice cream to the front porch of the patio. SCP-96 will often give the same ice cream sandwiches to adjacent members of the household, as well as stay outside the home for any reason.

When given ice cream, SCP-96 will attempt to sneak into the courtyard to eat the ice cream sandwiches. Afterwards, SCP-96 will shuffle around the house in a gait that resembles that of a human, and may occasionally consultant that Ice Cream seems to be an 'adult' thing.

At the end of each day, SCP-96 will either enter the containment area, or leave the containment area, and return to its room with SCP-96.

Addendum: External surveillance conducted after Incident-96-01.

SCP-96's last known whereabouts and the address of the house is unknown. Police records show that SCP-96 has not been seen since Incident (96-01). Recent surveillance recordings can still be heard across the property, but the access to them has been restricted to Level 2 personnel.

Addendum: A list of members of the Outside-Site staff, and the number of household members, can be found on file at Site-19.
