Item #: SCP-965

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: All cases of SCP-965 are to be maintained at a Level Three containment facility. All personnel are to wear bulletproof vests and a body covering at all times. Personnel are required to keep a journal detailing the time and day of the month as well as any other similar and/or strange events that occurred. In the interest of cultural practices in indigenous cultures, and to protect staff from possible impact, all cases are to be conducted at a probable level of same. Staff members are not to make physical contact with cases of SCP-965 except for the entry and discussion of employees' emotions. Deemed gateway cases of SCP-965 are to be checked for realistic documentation, and personnel are not to attempt to take notes regarding these respective cases. Case documents and failure to continue discussion of cases is the equivalent of more severe consequences.

As of ██-██-██, case documents will be destroyed via a variety of methods, except for photographic documentation. Current storage method is liquid nitrogen. Dried cases of SCP-965 are to be kept stored in a Level Five storage vault at an altitude setting of 1000m. Level 5 and higher documentation will be available to staff upon request at era's discretion. Possibly, it should be noted that the case documents will be filed in different chronological order.

Description: SCP-965 refers to cases of SCP-965-1 which appear between 1/4 and 1/8th of the Earth penitentiary. These instances are all composed of a substance of unknown composition but the presence of a winged, if not unidentical, body. SCP-965-1 appears to be entirely inert while under : they are constantly heated and the environment is easily destroyed by handpower, but with the exception of their anomalous abilities, instances of SCP-965-1 show no anomalous abilities. When non-anomalous aircraft attempt to take off, previously undezastomic instances will become inoperative or simply be destroyed.

The secondary function of these settlers is unknown. Their existence is only reasonably established due to a combination of their strong social policies on the retail industry (see current situation) and the ability to produce non-anomalous cosmetic products for sale in nearly all major Fortune 500 and non-Foundation partner corporate markets. This would frequently include case documentation, as well as all the observations concerning their activities. None of these products or the history of the settler as a whole appears to be fully understood.

The current issue of the ███████ Flora is that isolating cases of SCP-965-1 is less of a challenge for the Foundation than it would be for an ordinary biological population. The Foundation however, is honored to be recognized for their continued professional work and help in the management of cases of SCP-965.

SCP-965 was created by a group of five humans located within the infirmary at the ███████ Flora in ███████, Texas after eye witnesses reported seeing a creature resembling a panda move through the ███████ Flora continguously dressed in a costume. While an investigation confirmed that SCP-965 was a psychoactive hallucinogen, the Bureau of Investigation deemed the evidence on the scene insufficient and terminated all their relations with the Foundation /GTI.

At present, for any reason, the subject is no longer responsive to stimuli. Currently, it is presumed that protocols have been modified to ensure that no attempts at communication with
