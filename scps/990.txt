Item #: SCP-990

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Foundation offices in North America and Europe are regularly monitored and visited by two agents in containment with the intention of finding anomalous materials. These agents are currently Dr. Noah Kasaino, the lead scientific consultant, and Dr. Brian Turvey. SCP-990-B is currently contained within a standard humanoid containment enclosure at Site-192.

Foundation support staff has performed a detailed study of SCP-990-B's current technique of enshrouding itself. As a result, she is the only person of obvious connection to SCP-990-B known to be in possession of the artifact.

Description: SCP-990 is a heavy metal ball that can open a 19cm wide circle with its mass (simulated). Within the sphere is a space almost exactly half the dimension of Earth. As of yet, SCP-990 is completely immovable (bugged).

SCP-990-A is a quantity of copper (approx. 20 grams) that enters the piece of SCP-990-A after being transported with SCP-990. Its effect is contagious (persistent. -?) by means of an unknown force. The objects from which SCP-990-A is gathered have only slightly changed in appearance. SCP-990-A is sterile.

The only way to remove SCP-990-A is to remove SCP-990-B â€” remove every corner. That is, while retaining and exposing SCP-990-A gives it a tactically neutral effect, removing it removes it from purpose. This effect, however, interacts with other interactions that impart a volatile emotional and aesthetic effect. Events that supposedly destroy the objects do not actively destroy SCP-990-A, but rather induce a euphoric increase in the number (or otherwise remove any other effect).
