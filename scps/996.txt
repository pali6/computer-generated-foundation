Description: On May 25th, 1916, city officials recognized an increased threat from the military forces of the Free State of China. Merchants across the country feared that this meant an imminent attack and dispatched schemes.

Around the same time that May 25th, myself and several fellow citizens were treated for agitations associated with the events on May 20th. The celebration took place on May 25th, but I was unable to track the event and only came in contact with the public to report on the event.

I was quickly arrested by the Bureau and pressed for information. After requesting full cooperation from the Bureau, and having received permission to share information, I was taken into custody.

It's not known when or if I was detained, however it is currently unknown if I am still alive, or if this same procedure has been used elsewhere. I can only reiterate that I'm no longer a threat to the First Order.

Foremost, what I am currently is a merchant. I wish this course of events could have been avoided.

On May 25th, the streets of Cairo, Egypt, began to circulate and banish any protestors that had gathered. Additional law enforcement was called in, and collected. After initial attributions, it was determined that the incident was related to a town called Niqshan in the province of Inner Suez.

In the town of Niqshan, the official government declared that the flooding had caused the town to collapse, which is what they did for most of the protesters. So a deeper investigation was called in, and one by one, the town was recognized under the auspicious of the First Order. The First Order, as they also referred to it, the Foundation and the various groups that would become the First Order, tried to help with restrictions and price controls, currently affecting the clothing and for mundane communications along with a comprehensive list of requirements for the area around the town.

It was stated that protesters ended up in the actions as part of the protests, and so were unable to turn to protest themselves. They did not disrupt the local government, and were rather peacefully organizing the town's ticket going to the upcoming elections.

If I had known then what on May 25th, we could have avoided this. I personally will continue to help the city with a strategy to limit further suffering and violence.

If I knew then what I did, I would have been on the
