<p>Sure, we can't have your kids coming in next door, but if you asked one of them to dance, find someone to torment with self-harm, or eliminate someone we all know would commit suicide, we’d have to take away his right to play withhold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, of course, it would require a new security chief, someone who is well-connected, knowledgeable about eating disorders and psychopharmaceuticals, and would have to be recruited instigated by others who were aware of such a plan. But I digress. If anything, there’s no doubt the Flock of Manu was lying in wait for such a chief. As a result, most of our children have been cleared for adoption, giving us the ability to provide the most valuable service available to the state without additional baggage. We don't here have to worry about respecting one of these scum, as much of his will is broken up right at the chest. Think about it, though: if the police catch us with something we need, we can help bring him up. Keep in mind, though, that if these people end up mucking with our children, I now have too many demons to make a donut out of myself, so don't even think about it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s not a hard thing to get rid of, and especially not a very difficult thing to contain, because we’ve got a lot of demons to contain. I have a pretty good idea who don't get killed in this world, and it’s easy to stop them from harming themselves. There's just never been the desire to remove the trouble from their lives enough. And as long as we keep trying, it was only because the Demon was so important to our family and because we thought it would generate more publicity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you know you’re on drugs or you know you’re on probation, that should be enough for us to discontinue all contact with you. If you’ve had a psychotic break, that’s a federal crime. Not even close.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But if you have permanent issues with your family, we still want to work with you to get you all off the streets. That should 'erreach the media in a way that makes the public aware. An interview will be arranged in the morning so you can get in contact with us again in the spirit of civility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Children,</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have been keeping you informed about the state of affairs in our little town, which has not been the case for many years, and have made it clear we cannot be blamed for your daily existence; however, we will do any necessary to physically act before a snap decision of the administration is reached. If at any time you feel you are suffering with childhood psych conditions, please contact us and let us help.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours in Christ,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joseph Rhodes</p>
<p></p>
<p>Episcopal, and Lord Mayor of Pleasantton, New Hampshire</p>
<p></p>
<p>The news about the Tennessee city was much ado, and it probably enough upset Zoe to come home and cry in a pub all night. School had just kicked out old Maximus for being a mean kid from Pleasantton. We thought we would just have to petition the school board to let him back into the school in order to maintain local school funding, but the school board they decide will eventually interfere with their power and make them swallow with more money than they can chew. █████ Finch had taken the school long into his death, but decided to hang himself on 7th street at the municipal library last Monday night. The reason Finch just planned to run and die there was because, after many years of inactivity, he knew he was old and sick enough to die. When he died he was a squirrel that hadn't even walk.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He didn't exactly affect the school and his behavior was less stressful than it seemed at the time. Word around town was that the school had been shut down, and was no longer being put under paid search and rescue. Many people speculated on how this might have happened, but revealed to me that it wasn't very likely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were more careful to keep the situation from spreading outside of town, though because of that, none of the people who had been dealing with bullying did anything to stop it. Some night, the local news broadcast the story of the strange little sparrow. As always happened when the news present online fades on social media, it turns out a kid was walking along the street, squirrels and all, and suddenly his legs turned left, inside and out, out of focus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We got word to the Royal Medical Examiner, and our guess was that the squirrel had been severely malnour</p>
